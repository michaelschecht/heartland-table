## 3. Photography Direction

### Style Philosophy: "Authentic Aspirational"
Food should look delicious AND achievable — not overly fussy

### Lighting
- **Primary:** Soft, natural golden window light
- **Direction:** Side or back lighting for depth and warmth

### Composition
- Mix of overhead flat lays and eye-level shots
- Shallow depth of field for intimacy
- Ample negative space around food
- Focus on texture and steam

### Styling
- **Props:** Cast iron, wooden cutting boards, ceramic plates, vintage glassware, linen napkins, mason jars, wheat stalks
- **Philosophy:** "Perfectly imperfect" — crumbs, drips, rumpled napkins add authenticity
- **Portions:** Generous, abundant, hearty

### Process & Environmental Shots
- Key process shots for complex recipes
- Ingredient still lifes as chapter dividers
- Subtle human elements (hands mixing dough)
- Backgrounds: weathered wood, rustic countertops, simple backdrops

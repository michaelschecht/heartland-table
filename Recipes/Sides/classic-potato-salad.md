## Ingredients

- 2 lbs (900g) russet or Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cut into ½-inch cubes

## Instructions

1. **Cook Potatoes:** Place potato cubes in a large pot and cover with cold, salted water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until potatoes are fork-tender but not mushy.
2. **Drain & Season:** Drain the potatoes well and return them to the warm pot. Immediately sprinkle with white vinegar and gently toss. Let cool for 10-15 minutes.
3. **Prepare Dressing:** In a large bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, yellow mustard, finely diced celery, and chopped red or green onion. If using, add chopped hard-boiled eggs and fresh dill.
4. **Combine:** Add the slightly cooled potatoes to the dressing mixture. Gently fold until the potatoes are evenly coated. Be careful not to mash the potatoes too much.
5. **Season & Chill:** Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or preferably overnight, to allow the flavors to meld.
6. **Serve:** Before serving, give the potato salad a gentle stir. Garnish with a sprinkle of paprika and extra fresh dill, if desired.

- Experiment with different herbs like chives or parsley in addition to (or instead of) dill.
- For a touch of sweetness, add a tablespoon of sweet pickle relish to the dressing.
- If the potato salad seems too dry after chilling, stir in an extra tablespoon of mayonnaise or milk.

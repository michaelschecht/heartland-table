- 1 cup (240ml) ketchup
- ½ cup (120ml) packed light brown sugar
- ¼ cup (60ml) molasses (unsulphured)

## Instructions

1. **Cook Bacon & Onions:** In a large, oven-safe Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot, cook the diced bacon over medium heat until crispy. Remove bacon with a slotted spoon and set aside, reserving about 2 tablespoons of bacon fat in the pot. Add the finely chopped onion to the pot and cook in the reserved bacon fat until softened and translucent, about 6-8 minutes.
2. **Combine Ingredients:** Add the undrained pork and beans and the drained and rinsed kidney beans to the pot. Stir in the ketchup, brown sugar, molasses, apple cider vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, dry mustard powder, and garlic powder. Mix well to combine all ingredients.
3. **Season:** Taste the mixture and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper as needed. Remember that bacon and pork and beans can already be salty.
4. **Bake:** Bring the bean mixture to a gentle simmer on the stovetop. Once simmering, remove from heat, cover the Dutch oven (or transfer to a 9x13 inch baking dish and cover with foil), and bake in a preheated oven at 350°F (175°C) for 1 hour.
5. **Finish & Serve:** After 1 hour, remove the cover/foil, stir the beans, and sprinkle the reserved crispy bacon bits over the top. Bake uncovered for an additional 15-30 minutes, or until the sauce is thick and bubbly and the beans are heated through. Let rest for a few minutes before serving.

## Tips & Variations

- For extra smokiness, add a teaspoon of liquid smoke or smoked paprika to the bean mixture.
- Add a finely chopped bell pepper (green or red) along with the onion for more vegetable flavor and color.
- If you prefer a vegetarian version, omit the bacon and use a vegetarian baked bean brand, adjusting seasonings to taste. You can add a tablespoon of smoked paprika for a smoky flavor.
- For a touch of heat, add a pinch of red pepper flakes or a dash of hot sauce.

*📸 Photography note: Rustic farmhouse style. A bubbling, glazed ceramic crock or a cast iron Dutch oven filled with rich, dark baked beans, garnished with crispy bacon bits. A wooden spoon is gently resting in the dish. The dish is placed on a weathered wooden picnic table or a checkered tablecloth, bathed in warm, natural outdoor light.*

## 👵 Grandma's Secret: Baked Beans

> "Grandma June always added a secret spoonful of **strong brewed coffee** (about 2 tablespoons!) to her baked beans. 'It just deepens the flavor and makes 'em extra rich,' she'd declare, 'everyone always says they're the best, but they can't quite put their finger on why!'"

## Ingredients

- 1 cup (240ml) warm milk (105-115°F / 40-46°C)
- 2 ¼ tsp active dry yeast (1 standard packet)
- 2 tbsp (25g) granulated sugar
- 1 large egg, lightly beaten
- ¼ cup (56g) unsalted butter, melted and cooled, plus more for brushing
- 1 tsp salt
- 3 to 3 ½ cups (360-420g) all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting

## Instructions

1. **Activate Yeast:** In a large bowl, combine the warm milk and granulated sugar. Sprinkle the active dry yeast over the top and let sit for 5-10 minutes, or until foamy.
2. **Combine Wet Ingredients:** Stir in the lightly beaten egg, melted butter, and salt into the yeast mixture.
3. **Add Flour:** Gradually add 3 cups of flour, mixing with a wooden spoon or dough hook until a shaggy dough forms. If the dough is too sticky, add more flour, a tablespoon at a time, until it pulls away from the sides of the bowl.
4. **Knead Dough:** Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5-7 minutes until it's smooth and elastic. Alternatively, knead with a stand mixer for 3-5 minutes.
5. **First Rise:** Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, turning once to coat. Cover with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel and let rise in a warm place for 1 to 1.5 hours, or until doubled in size.
6. **Shape Rolls:** Gently punch down the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough into 12-16 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a smooth ball.
7. **Second Rise:** Arrange the shaped rolls in a lightly greased 9x13 inch (23x33 cm) baking dish, leaving a small space between them. Cover again and let rise for another 30-45 minutes, or until puffy.
8. **Preheat Oven:** While the rolls are on their second rise, preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
9. **Bake:** Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the tops are golden brown.
10. **Butter & Serve:** Immediately after removing from the oven, brush the tops of the hot rolls with a little melted butter. Serve warm.

## Tips & Variations

- For an extra rich flavor, substitute some of the milk with heavy cream.
- Add a tablespoon of fresh chopped herbs like rosemary or thyme to the dough for savory rolls.
- Make ahead: After the second rise, cover the rolls tightly and refrigerate overnight. Let them come to room temperature for 30-45 minutes before baking, adding a few extra minutes to the bake time.
- For softer crusts, place the baking dish of rolls on a lower rack in the oven and place a pan of hot water on the rack below it while baking.

# Beer Bread

📍 *Wisconsin, Michigan, Across the Midwest — Wherever There's a Spare Beer*

> Three cups of flour, a can of beer, and about fifteen minutes of actual effort produce a dense, golden, slightly boozy loaf with a buttery crust that shatters when you tear into it. It's the bread equivalent of showing up to a party in jeans and still being the best-dressed person there.

## 🫕 Midwest Nice Rating: 🫕🫕🫕🫕

Shows up to every party. The recipe has three ingredients. Even your cousin who burns water can make this.

---

## Ingredients

- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 3 tablespoons granulated sugar
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 can or bottle (12 ounces) beer, at room temperature (see notes on beer choice)
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

---

## Instructions

1. **Preheat.** Crank your oven to 375°F. Grease a standard 9 × 5-inch loaf pan generously with butter or cooking spray.

2. **Mix the dry.** In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.

3. **Add the beer.** Pour in the beer and stir with a wooden spoon until just combined. The batter will be thick, shaggy, and slightly lumpy. It should look like it's not quite ready. It is. Don't overmix. The carbonation in the beer is doing the leavening work — don't knock all the bubbles out.

4. **Pan it.** Scrape the batter into the prepared loaf pan and spread it roughly even. It doesn't need to be pretty. Pour the melted butter over the top of the batter, letting it pool around the edges.

5. **Bake.** Bake for 50–55 minutes, until the top is deeply golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. The butter will have created a shatteringly crispy, golden crust on top.

6. **Cool briefly and devour.** Let the bread cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn it out onto a cutting board. Slice thick. Eat warm with more butter. Reflect on how something this easy has no right to be this good.

## Tips & Variations

- **Beer Choice Matters:** A standard lager or pale ale (Miller, PBR, Spotted Cow if you're in Wisconsin and feeling proud) makes a classic, mildly flavored loaf. A wheat beer adds softness. An IPA adds bitterness and hops flavor — good if you like that, intense if you don't. A dark stout makes a heavier, more complex bread. Start with whatever's in your fridge.
- **Cheesy Beer Bread:** Fold in 1 cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese. Sprinkle another ½ cup on top before baking. This is the correct move.
- **Herb Version:** Add 2 teaspoons of dried Italian herbs and 2 minced garlic cloves to the batter.
- **Honey Beer Bread:** Replace the sugar with 3 tablespoons of honey. Drizzle more honey on top with the melted butter.
- **Don't Skip the Butter on Top:** It's not optional. The melted butter poured over the batter before baking is what creates the crunchy, golden-brown crust that makes this bread special. Without it, you just have a sad, pale loaf.
- **Serve With:** Beer cheese soup (page reference to Wisconsin Beer Cheese Soup), chili, or just a bowl of good butter.

> **🤫 Grandma's Secret:** *"Use a beer you actually like drinking — if you wouldn't drink it, don't bake with it. And let the beer come to room temperature first. Cold beer shocks the baking powder and you'll get a denser loaf."*

## Pairs Well With

The rest of the six-pack that donated the one beer to the bread, a Packers game, and the quiet satisfaction of telling everyone you "baked bread from scratch" without mentioning it took five minutes.

## 🌾 Did You Know?

> Beer bread's popularity in the Midwest tracks perfectly with two regional obsessions: beer and not making things complicated. The recipe likely evolved from quick bread traditions (baking powder breads that don't require yeast or rising time) and got its boozy twist sometime in the mid-20th century, when home brewers and practical cooks realized that beer's carbonation and yeast could serve as a leavening agent. Wisconsin claims a special relationship with beer bread — which makes sense, given that the state has more breweries per capita than nearly anywhere else in America. In the 1970s and 80s, beer bread mixes became popular gift items at Midwestern craft fairs and church bazaars, packaged in mason jars with cute labels. The mix was literally just flour, sugar, and baking powder — you were paying $8 for someone to pre-measure three ingredients. The Midwest: where entrepreneurship meets audacity.

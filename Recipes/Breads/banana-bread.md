## Ingredients

- 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- ½ tsp salt
- 1 tsp ground cinnamon (optional)
- ½ cup (113g) unsalted butter, melted
- 1 cup (200g) granulated sugar
- 2 large eggs, lightly beaten
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 3 very ripe medium bananas, mashed (about 1 cup)
- Optional: ½ cup chopped walnuts or pecans, ½ cup chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. **Preheat Oven & Prepare Pan:** Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour a 9x5 inch (23x13 cm) loaf pan, or line with parchment paper.
2. **Combine Dry Ingredients:** In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon (if using).
3. **Combine Wet Ingredients:** In a large bowl, whisk together the melted butter and granulated sugar until well combined. Stir in the lightly beaten eggs and vanilla extract.
4. **Add Bananas:** Add the mashed bananas to the wet ingredients and mix until just combined.
5. **Combine All:** Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing with a wooden spoon or spatula until just combined. Be careful not to overmix; a few lumps are fine. If using, gently fold in the chopped nuts or chocolate chips.
6. **Pour & Bake:** Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan, spreading it evenly.
7. **Bake:** Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until a wooden skewer or toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. If the top starts to brown too quickly, you can loosely tent it with aluminum foil.
8. **Cool & Serve:** Let the banana bread cool in the pan for 10-15 minutes before inverting it onto a wire rack to cool completely. Slice and serve warm or at room temperature.

## Tips & Variations

- For a richer flavor, use brown sugar instead of granulated sugar, or a mix of both.
- Add a tablespoon of buttermilk or sour cream to the wet ingredients for an extra moist crumb.
- Experiment with different spices like nutmeg or a pinch of ground cloves for added warmth.
- For an extra banana flavor, roast the bananas in their peels in the oven at 300°F (150°C) for 15-20 minutes until they are black, then cool, peel, and mash.

## 👵 Grandma's Secret: Banana Bread

> "Grandma Carol always added a tiny splash of **orange juice** (about 2 tablespoons) to her banana bread batter. 'It just brightens up the banana flavor,' she'd insist, 'and makes it taste extra fresh, like a little bit of sunshine!'"

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. **Image Coverage – CRITICAL ISSUE**

**Current Status:**
- Puppy Chow: ✅ Image exists
- Cheese & Sausage Board: ⚠️ Referenced but missing
- Classic Popcorn Balls: ❌ No reference
- Peanut Brittle: ❌ No reference

**Recommended Actions:**

**PRIORITY 1 – Add Missing Image Reference Lines:**
```markdown
# Classic Popcorn Balls
📍 *Across the Midwest — Halloween, Harvest Festivals, and School Carnivals*

> [intro paragraph]

![Classic Popcorn Balls](../../Images/classic-popcorn-balls.jpg)
```

```markdown
# Peanut Brittle
📍 *Across the Midwest — Holiday Tins, Gift Bags, and Grandma's Kitchen*

> [intro paragraph]

![Peanut Brittle](../../Images/peanut-brittle.jpg)
```

**PRIORITY 2 – Create/Acquire Missing Images:**
- `cheese-and-sausage-board.jpg` (referenced but missing file)
- `classic-popcorn-balls.jpg` (need to create)
- `peanut-brittle.jpg` (need to create)

All three have excellent photography notes to guide creation.

### 2. **Minor Formatting Inconsistencies**

**Midwest Nice Rating:**
- Cheese & Sausage Board: Missing (doesn't hurt it, but inconsistent)
- Classic Popcorn Balls: ✅ Present (🫕🫕🫕🫕)
- Peanut Brittle: ✅ Present (🫕🫕🫕🫕)
- Puppy Chow: Missing

**Recommendation:** Either add to all or remove from all. Current 50/50 split creates inconsistency. Given that Puppy Chow and Cheese Board work fine without it, suggest making it optional rather than mandatory for simpler/more casual recipes.

**"Pairs Well With" Section:**
- Classic Popcorn Balls: ✅ Present and brilliant
- Peanut Brittle: ✅ Present and excellent
- Cheese & Sausage Board: Missing
- Puppy Chow: Missing

**Recommendation:** These sections add personality and work particularly well for these recipes. Consider adding to the other two, though not critical since they're more straightforward serve-anywhere snacks.

## Conclusion

The Snacks section is **exceptionally well-written** and represents some of the strongest work in the cookbook. The recipes capture authentic Midwestern snacking culture – from casual party spreads to holiday candy-making traditions. Each recipe is approachable, well-explained, and culturally grounded.

**The only significant issue is image coverage (25% complete).** With images added, this section would be publication-ready and would serve as a strong example of the cookbook's style and quality.

All four recipes demonstrate:
- Clear understanding of the target audience
- Respect for tradition with room for adaptation
- Practical, realistic instructions
- Genuine cultural knowledge and affection
- Distinctive voice that's warm without being cloying

**Final Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐½ (4.5/5)**  
*Would be 5/5 with complete image coverage.*

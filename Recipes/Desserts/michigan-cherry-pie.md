## Instructions

1. **Make Pie Crust:** In a large bowl, whisk together flour and salt. Cut in cold butter with a pastry blender or your fingertips until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs with some pea-sized butter pieces. Gradually add ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, mixing until dough just comes together. Do not overmix. Divide dough in half, flatten into discs, wrap in plastic, and chill for at least 30 minutes.
2. **Prepare Cherries:** In a large bowl, combine pitted cherries, granulated sugar, flour (or cornstarch), and lemon juice. If using, add almond extract. Stir gently to combine.
3. **Roll Out Crusts:** On a lightly floured surface, roll out one disc of dough into a 12-inch (30 cm) circle. Carefully transfer to a 9-inch (23 cm) pie plate. Trim edges, leaving about ½-inch overhang.
4. **Add Filling:** Pour the cherry filling into the pie crust. Dot the top of the filling with the small pieces of butter.
5. **Top Crust:** Roll out the second disc of dough. Place over the filling, or cut into strips to create a lattice top. Trim and crimp the edges of both crusts together to seal.
6. **Vent & Egg Wash (Optional):** Cut a few slits in the top crust (if not making lattice) to allow steam to escape. If desired, whisk together egg and water for an egg wash, brush over the top crust, and sprinkle with granulated sugar.
7. **Bake:** Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). Place pie on a baking sheet (to catch any drips). Bake for 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 375°F (190°C) and continue baking for 35-45 minutes more, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling. If the crust browns too quickly, loosely tent with foil.
8. **Cool & Serve:** Transfer pie to a wire rack and let cool completely for at least 3-4 hours before slicing and serving. This is crucial for the filling to set properly. Serve at room temperature, perhaps with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

## Tips & Variations

- Always use *tart* cherries for this recipe; sweet cherries will make the pie overly sweet.
- For a firmer filling, increase the cornstarch to 4 tablespoons.
- If using frozen cherries, do not thaw them first, as this can make the filling too watery.
- A pinch of cardamom in the filling can add a subtle, warm spice note.

## 👵 Grandma's Secret: Michigan Cherry Pie

> "Grandma Dorothy always added a tiny pinch of **cinnamon** (about ¼ teaspoon!) to her cherry filling. 'It just adds a little warmth and depth to the cherries,' she'd wink, 'makes it taste extra special, like a hug in every bite!'"

## Ingredients

### Peanut Butter Centers
- 1½ cups creamy peanut butter (such as Jif or Skippy — not natural)
- ½ cup unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- ⅛ teaspoon fine sea salt
- 3 cups powdered sugar, sifted

### Chocolate Coating
- 2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips
- 2 tablespoons vegetable shortening or coconut oil

## Instructions

1. **Make the peanut butter filling.** In a large bowl, beat the peanut butter, butter, vanilla, and salt with an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Gradually add the powdered sugar, ½ cup at a time, mixing on low until fully incorporated. The dough should be thick, smooth, and hold its shape when rolled.

2. **Roll the balls.** Using a tablespoon or small cookie scoop, portion the dough and roll into 1-inch balls between your palms. Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet. You should get about 48 balls.

3. **Chill.** Place the baking sheet in the freezer for at least 1 hour, or the refrigerator for 2 hours, until the balls are firm. This is essential — soft balls will fall apart during dipping.

4. **Melt the chocolate.** In a microwave-safe bowl, combine the chocolate chips and shortening. Microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring between each, until completely smooth (usually 3–4 rounds). Alternatively, melt in a double boiler over barely simmering water, stirring constantly.

5. **Dip the buckeyes.** Remove a few balls from the freezer at a time (keep the rest cold). Insert a toothpick into the top of a ball. Dip it into the melted chocolate about ¾ of the way, leaving a circle of peanut butter visible at the top — this is what makes it look like a buckeye nut. Let the excess chocolate drip off for a moment.

6. **Set the buckeyes.** Place each dipped candy back on the parchment-lined sheet. Once the chocolate starts to set, gently twist out the toothpick and smooth the hole with your fingertip or the back of a spoon.

7. **Chill to set.** Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes until the chocolate is completely firm and set.

8. **Store and serve.** Keep buckeyes in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 weeks, or freeze for up to 3 months. Serve slightly chilled.

## Tips & Variations

- **Peanut Butter Choice Matters:** Use standard commercial creamy peanut butter (Jif, Skippy, etc.). Natural peanut butter has too much oil and won't hold its shape.
- **The "Buckeye" Look:** The exposed peanut butter circle at the top is what makes these look like actual buckeye nuts. Don't fully dip them — that would make them truffles, not buckeyes. Ohioans will notice.
- **Pretzel Buckeyes:** Press each peanut butter ball onto a mini pretzel before dipping for a salty-sweet-crunchy variation.
- **White Chocolate Drizzle:** After the dark chocolate sets, drizzle with white chocolate for a fancy holiday presentation.
- **Almond Butter Version:** Substitute almond butter for a twist, though purists may object.
- **Perfect Tempering:** If your chocolate looks dull after setting, add a little more shortening to the melting chocolate next time, or temper it properly by seeding with chopped chocolate.

## 🌾 Did You Know?

> Ohio is "The Buckeye State," named for the prevalence of buckeye trees (*Aesculus glabra*) with their distinctive nuts — dark brown with a lighter tan circle on top. Real buckeye nuts are actually toxic to humans, but these candy versions are anything but. Buckeye candies are practically a state religion in Ohio, especially during football season. At Ohio State University tailgates, you'll find them on every table, passed around every living room during Buckeye games, and shipped by the tin to homesick Ohioans everywhere. The rivalry between Ohio State and Michigan even extends to these candies — Wolverine fans have been known to fully dip them in chocolate ("killing the buckeye"), a culinary act of war that no Ohioan takes lightly.

*📸 Photography note: A dozen buckeyes arranged on a small white pedestal plate, the peanut butter tops facing up like little eyes. One bitten in half to show the creamy interior. A few scattered on dark wax paper alongside. Deep autumnal background — maybe a wooden table with fall leaves. Warm, holiday-party lighting.*

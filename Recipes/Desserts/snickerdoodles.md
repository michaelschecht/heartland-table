## Ingredients

- 2 ¾ cups all-purpose flour
- 2 tsp cream of tartar
- 1 tsp baking soda
- ¼ tsp salt
- 1 cup (226g) unsalted butter, softened

## Instructions

1. **Whisk Dry Ingredients:** In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.
2. **Cream Butter & Sugar:** In a large bowl, using an electric mixer, cream together the softened butter and 1 ½ cups granulated sugar until light and fluffy, about 2-3 minutes.
3. **Add Eggs & Vanilla:** Beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.
4. **Combine Wet & Dry:** Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing on low speed until just combined. Do not overmix. The dough will be soft.
5. **Chill Dough:** Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and chill the dough in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. This helps prevent the cookies from spreading too much.
6. **Preheat Oven & Prepare Coating:** Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). In a small shallow dish, combine ¼ cup granulated sugar and 2 tbsp ground cinnamon for the coating.
7. **Shape & Coat Cookies:** Scoop rounded tablespoons of dough and roll them into balls. Roll each dough ball generously in the cinnamon-sugar mixture, ensuring it's fully coated.
8. **Bake:** Place the coated dough balls 2 inches apart on ungreased baking sheets. Bake for 8-10 minutes, or until the edges are set and lightly golden, but the centers are still soft and slightly puffy. The tops will have characteristic crackles.
9. **Cool:** Remove cookies from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheets for 2-3 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.

## Tips & Variations

- For an extra chewy cookie, underbake them slightly so the centers are very soft when they come out of the oven.
- Ensure your cream of tartar is fresh; it's essential for the unique tangy flavor and chewy texture of Snickerdoodles.
- For a warmer spice profile, add a pinch of nutmeg or ground cloves to the cinnamon-sugar coating.
- Make ahead: Dough balls can be rolled in cinnamon sugar and frozen on a baking sheet. Once solid, transfer to a freezer-safe bag and bake from frozen, adding a few minutes to the baking time.

## 🌾 Did You Know?

> Snickerdoodles are believed to have German or Dutch origins, possibly deriving from a German word like "Schneckennudeln" (snail noodles), which refers to a sweet pastry. However, they became a distinctly American cookie, especially popular in New England and later, the Midwest. Their whimsical name and comforting cinnamon-sugar flavor have made them a cherished treat for generations, often found in school lunchboxes, holiday cookie platters, and church bake sales across the heartland.

## 👵 Grandma's Secret: Snickerdoodles

> "Grandma Marge always added a tiny pinch of **cardamom** (just an eighth of a teaspoon!) to her cinnamon-sugar coating. 'It just gives it that extra special something,' she'd whisper, 'a little warmth that makes everyone ask for my recipe, but they never quite guess what it is!'"

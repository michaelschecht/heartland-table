# Frosted Sugar Cookies

📍 *Across the Midwest — Every Kitchen with a Cookie Sheet and a Dream*

> Thick, soft, pillowy sugar cookies with slightly crisp edges, topped with a smooth layer of sweet buttercream frosting in whatever color matches the nearest holiday. These aren't crispy sugar cookies. These aren't thin. These are the impossibly soft, cakey, frosted sugar cookies from the bakery at your small-town grocery store — the ones in the clear plastic clamshell that you pretend you're buying for the kids.

- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon salt

### The Frosting
- ½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened

## Instructions

1. **Cream the butter and sugar.** In a large bowl or stand mixer, beat the softened butter and sugar together on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Scrape down the sides.

2. **Add the eggs and extracts.** Beat in the eggs one at a time, then add the vanilla and almond extracts. Mix in the sour cream until combined.

3. **Add the dry ingredients.** In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients in three additions, mixing on low speed until just combined after each. The dough will be soft and slightly sticky.

4. **Chill.** Cover the dough and refrigerate for at least 1 hour (or up to overnight). Cold dough spreads less, which means thicker, puffier cookies.

5. **Shape.** Preheat your oven to 350°F. Line baking sheets with parchment paper. Scoop the dough into 2-tablespoon balls (a cookie scoop is your friend) and place 2 inches apart on the baking sheets. Flatten each ball slightly with the bottom of a glass or your palm — you want them about ¾ inch thick.

6. **Bake.** Bake for 10–12 minutes, until the edges are barely set and the tops still look slightly underdone. They will NOT look done. Remove them anyway. They'll continue cooking on the hot pan. Overbaked sugar cookies are dry sugar cookies, and dry sugar cookies are a tragedy.

7. **Cool completely.** Let the cookies cool on the pan for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before frosting. This is the hardest step. Be patient.

8. **Make the frosting.** Beat the softened butter until smooth. Gradually add the powdered sugar, alternating with the cream, beating on medium speed until light, fluffy, and spreadable. Add vanilla and salt. Tint with food coloring if desired.

9. **Frost and decorate.** Spread a thick layer of frosting on each cookie with a butter knife or offset spatula. Add sprinkles immediately before the frosting sets. Admire your work. Eat one as quality control.

## Tips & Variations

- **The Sour Cream:** This is what makes the cookies impossibly soft and tender. The acidity reacts with the baking soda, creating a lighter, cakier texture. Don't substitute yogurt — the fat content of sour cream matters.
- **Almond Extract:** Just ½ teaspoon transforms these from "good sugar cookies" to "what's your recipe" sugar cookies. The almond flavor is subtle — most people can't identify it, but they taste the difference.
- **Roll-Out Cookies:** This dough can also be rolled out and cut with cookie cutters for holidays. Roll to ¼ inch thick for cutouts. Chill the rolled dough again before cutting for cleaner shapes.
- **Don't Overbake:** This is the single most important tip. Pull them when they look underdone. The residual heat will finish the job. A perfectly baked sugar cookie should be slightly pale on top with just a hint of golden on the edges.
- **Frosting Consistency:** Add cream a tablespoon at a time. You want the frosting thick enough to hold its shape when spread, but smooth enough to spread easily. If it's too stiff, add more cream. Too thin, add more powdered sugar.
- **Holiday Rotation:** Pink frosting with heart sprinkles (Valentine's Day). Pastel with egg-shaped sprinkles (Easter). Red, white, and blue (4th of July). Orange and black (Halloween). Red and green (Christmas). This cookie does the work of six different recipes.

> **🤫 Grandma's Secret:** *"A tablespoon of cornstarch in the flour — it keeps the cookies pillowy soft even the next day. And refrigerate the frosted cookies for 10 minutes before stacking them for transport. The frosting will set and they won't stick together in the container."*

## Pairs Well With

A kindergarten Valentine's Day party, a Christmas cookie exchange where yours are the first to disappear, a cup of coffee while standing in the kitchen pretending you're not about to eat a fourth cookie, and the realization that the grocery store version was always just trying to be this.

## 🌾 Did You Know?

> The soft, thick, frosted sugar cookie — distinct from the thin, crispy European-style sugar cookie — is an American invention that reached its peak form in the Midwest. The style traces back to the Pennsylvania Dutch "Nazareth sugar cookie" of the 18th century, but the modern soft-and-frosted version evolved in Midwestern kitchens during the 20th century, when ingredients like sour cream and baking powder became widely available and home bakers prioritized tenderness over crispness. The grocery store version (you know the ones — in the plastic clamshell container, neon pink frosting, served at every school party) became iconic in the 1990s, produced by regional bakeries like Lofthouse. Midwesterners have a complicated relationship with Lofthouse cookies: they're objectively mediocre, but they trigger such powerful nostalgia that criticizing them feels like criticizing a family member. This recipe is better than Lofthouse. You're welcome to tell people that, but be prepared for the debate.

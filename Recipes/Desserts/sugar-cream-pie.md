## Ingredients

- 1 (9-inch / 23 cm) unbaked pie crust (homemade or store-bought)
- 1 ½ cups (300g) granulated sugar
- ½ cup (60g) all-purpose flour
- ½ tsp ground nutmeg, plus more for sprinkling
- 2 cups (480ml) heavy cream or half-and-half (do not use milk)
- ¼ cup (56g) unsalted butter, melted
- 1 tsp vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. **Preheat Oven & Prepare Crust:** Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Place the unbaked pie crust in a 9-inch (23 cm) pie plate.
2. **Whisk Dry Ingredients:** In a medium bowl, whisk together the granulated sugar, flour, and ½ tsp nutmeg until thoroughly combined. This helps prevent lumps in the filling.
3. **Combine Wet Ingredients:** In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the heavy cream (or half-and-half), melted butter, and vanilla extract.
4. **Form Filling:** Gradually whisk the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until smooth.
5. **Pour into Crust:** Pour the creamy filling into the unbaked pie crust.
6. **Bake:** Bake for 15 minutes at 400°F (200°C).
7. **Reduce Heat & Finish Baking:** Reduce the oven temperature to 350°F (175°C) and continue baking for another 30-40 minutes, or until the edges are set but the center still has a slight jiggle. The pie will firm up as it cools. If the crust starts to brown too quickly, you can loosely tent it with aluminum foil.
8. **Cool & Serve:** Transfer the pie to a wire rack and let it cool completely for at least 3-4 hours before slicing and serving. This is crucial for the filling to set properly. Sprinkle with a little extra nutmeg just before serving, if desired.

## Tips & Variations

- For an extra rich flavor, use all heavy cream. Half-and-half will yield a slightly lighter but still delicious pie.
- Ensure the filling ingredients are at room temperature for a smoother consistency.
- If your pie crust is prone to shrinking, you can blind bake it for 10-15 minutes before adding the filling.
- Serve slightly chilled or at room temperature. It doesn't typically need whipped cream, but a dollop can be a nice addition.

## 🌾 Did You Know?

> Sugar Cream Pie is Indiana's official state pie and a true culinary emblem of the Hoosier State. Originating with early Shaker and Quaker settlers, it was a practical "desperation pie" made with readily available pantry staples (sugar, cream, flour, spices) during times when fresh fruit was scarce. This simple, unpretentious dessert became a beloved tradition, symbolizing the resourcefulness and comforting spirit of Midwestern home baking.

Served on a simple ceramic plate, on a rustic wooden table, with soft, natural light from a window. A vintage pie server should be partially submerged in a slice.*

## 👵 Grandma's Secret: Sugar Cream Pie

> "Grandma Eleanor always added a tiny splash of **bourbon** (just a teaspoon!) to her cream filling before baking. 'It just deepens the vanilla and warms up the spices,' she'd whisper, 'a little something extra that makes it truly irresistible, bless its heart!'"

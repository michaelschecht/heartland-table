## Ingredients

- 4 large eggs
- 2 cups (480ml) whole milk
- 1 cup (240ml) heavy cream
- 1 cup (200g) granulated sugar
- 1 tbsp vanilla extract
- 1 tsp ground cinnamon
- ½ tsp ground nutmeg
- ¼ tsp salt
- Optional: ½ cup raisins or dried cranberries

**For the Bourbon Sauce:**

## Instructions

1. **Prepare Baking Dish:** Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch (23x33 cm) baking dish.
2. **Arrange Bread:** Scatter the bread cubes evenly in the prepared baking dish. If using, sprinkle the raisins or dried cranberries over the bread.
3. **Make Custard:** In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, heavy cream, granulated sugar, vanilla extract, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt until well combined.
4. **Pour Custard Over Bread:** Pour the custard mixture evenly over the bread cubes, making sure all the bread is moistened. Gently press down on the bread with a spoon to ensure it soaks up the custard. Let sit for 10-15 minutes.
5. **Bake:** Bake for 45-55 minutes, or until the pudding is set, golden brown on top, and a knife inserted into the center comes out mostly clean.
6. **Make Bourbon Sauce:** While the pudding bakes, prepare the sauce. In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Stir in the granulated sugar and cook, stirring constantly, until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture is smooth.
7. **Add Bourbon & Cream:** Carefully remove from heat and slowly whisk in the bourbon, heavy cream, and vanilla extract. Return to low heat and simmer gently for 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly, until slightly thickened. Be careful not to boil.
8. **Serve:** Let the bread pudding cool for a few minutes before serving. Cut into squares and generously drizzle with the warm bourbon sauce. Serve immediately.

## Tips & Variations

- For a richer flavor, toast the bread cubes slightly before adding them to the baking dish.
- Experiment with different types of bread, such as challah or brioche, for a more luxurious texture.
- Add a tablespoon of orange zest to the custard for a bright, citrusy note.
- For a non-alcoholic sauce, replace the bourbon with apple juice or a strong brewed coffee.

## 👵 Grandma's Secret: Bread Pudding with Bourbon Sauce

> "Grandma Lucille always soaked her raisins (or cranberries!) in a little extra bourbon for about 30 minutes before adding them to the pudding. 'It plumps them up just right,' she'd declare with a wink, 'and adds a little extra zing that makes this pudding truly special!'"

## Instructions

1. **Prep the spinach.** Thaw frozen spinach and squeeze out as much liquid as possible using a clean kitchen towel or several layers of paper towels. This step is crucial — wet spinach makes watery dip.

2. **Make the base.** Preheat oven to 375°F. In a large mixing bowl, combine softened cream cheese, sour cream, and mayonnaise. Beat with an electric mixer or stir vigorously until smooth and creamy.

3. **Add the flavors.** Stir in minced garlic, Parmesan cheese, and ½ cup of the mozzarella. Mix until well combined.

4. **Fold in the vegetables.** Add the chopped artichoke hearts and drained spinach. Fold gently until evenly distributed. Season with salt, pepper, red pepper flakes (if using), and nutmeg.

5. **Transfer and top.** Spread the mixture evenly into an 8-inch oven-safe skillet, small baking dish, or pie plate. Sprinkle the remaining ½ cup mozzarella over the top.

6. **Bake.** Bake for 20–25 minutes until the dip is bubbling around the edges and the cheese on top is melted and golden in spots.

7. **Broil for color (optional).** For extra golden cheese, place under the broiler for 1–2 minutes. Watch carefully to prevent burning.

8. **Serve hot.** Let cool for 5 minutes (it's volcanic inside), then serve with your choice of dippers.

## Tips & Variations

- **Squeeze the Spinach:** This cannot be overstated. Wet spinach = sad, watery dip. Get it bone dry.
- **Make Ahead:** Assemble the dip, cover, and refrigerate for up to 24 hours. Add 5–10 minutes to the bake time if baking from cold.
- **Slow Cooker Version:** Combine all ingredients in a slow cooker. Cook on low for 2–3 hours, stirring occasionally, until hot and bubbly.
- **Jalapeño Addition:** Add 2–3 tablespoons diced pickled jalapeños for heat.
- **Bacon Lover's:** Top with crumbled crispy bacon before serving.
- **Bread Bowl:** Hollow out a round bread loaf, fill with dip, and bake. Use the bread pieces for dipping.
- **Extra Cheesy:** Add ½ cup shredded white cheddar or Gruyère to the mix.
- **Fresh Spinach:** Use 8 oz fresh spinach, sautéed until wilted and excess moisture cooked off.

## 🌾 Did You Know?

> Spinach artichoke dip became an American restaurant staple in the 1980s and 1990s, appearing on chain restaurant menus from coast to coast. The Midwest embraced it wholeheartedly — it hit all the right notes: creamy, cheesy, easy to make in big batches, and perfect for sharing. It became a fixture at Super Bowl parties, potlucks, and holiday gatherings. The combination of spinach and artichoke likely originated from Italian-American cuisine, but the addition of cream cheese and baking it until bubbly is pure American innovation. Today, it remains one of the most requested appetizers at any Heartland gathering.

## Ingredients

- 1 (16 oz / 450g) jar dill pickle slices (sandwich slices work well), patted very dry
- 1.5 cups all-purpose flour, divided
- 1 tsp baking powder
- ½ tsp salt
- ¼ tsp black pepper
- ¼ tsp garlic powder
- 1 (12 oz / 355ml) can cold beer (lager or pilsner recommended)
- 4-6 cups vegetable oil, for frying
- Optional: Ranch dressing or spicy aioli, for serving

## Instructions

1. **Pat Pickles Dry:** Lay pickle slices on paper towels and pat them as dry as possible. This is crucial for a crispy batter.
2. **Prepare Battering Station:** In a large bowl, whisk together 1 cup of the all-purpose flour, baking powder, salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Gradually whisk in the cold beer until a smooth batter forms. Do not overmix; a few lumps are fine.
3. **Dredge Pickles:** Place the remaining ½ cup of flour in a separate shallow dish. Dredge the dried pickle slices in this flour first, shaking off any excess. This helps the beer batter adhere.
4. **Heat Oil:** In a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven, pour vegetable oil to a depth of about 2-3 inches. Heat the oil over medium-high heat until it reaches 350°F (175°C). Use a deep-fry thermometer to monitor the temperature.
5. **Batter & Fry:** Working in small batches, dip each floured pickle slice into the beer batter, allowing excess to drip off. Carefully place the battered pickles into the hot oil. Fry for 2-3 minutes, flipping once, until golden brown and crispy.
6. **Drain & Season:** Using a slotted spoon, transfer the fried pickles to a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess oil. Immediately sprinkle with a pinch of salt.
7. **Serve:** Serve hot with ranch dressing or spicy aioli for dipping.

## Tips & Variations

- Use a light, crisp beer for the batter for the best results. Highly carbonated beer will yield a lighter, crispier batter.
- For extra spice, add a pinch of cayenne pepper to the dry batter mix.
- Experiment with different pickle varieties, such as bread and butter pickles, for a sweeter tang.
- Ensure the oil maintains a consistent temperature; overcrowding the pot will lower the temperature and make the pickles greasy.

## 👵 Grandma's Secret: Beer-Battered Fried Pickles

> "Grandma Jean always said the trick was to use an *ice-cold* beer for the batter. 'It makes the batter extra light and crispy,' she'd wink, 'like a little cloud around that pickle, don't you know!'"

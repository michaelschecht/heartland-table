## Ingredients

- 8 oz (225g) sharp cheddar cheese, shredded
- 4 oz (113g) cream cheese, softened
- ½ cup (120g) mayonnaise (Duke's or a good quality regional brand recommended)
- 1 (4 oz / 113g) jar diced pimentos, drained very well
- 1-2 tbsp (15-30ml) pickled jalapeño juice (or pickle juice)
- ½ tsp garlic powder
- ¼ tsp onion powder
- ⅛ tsp cayenne pepper (or more, to taste)
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- For serving: Crackers, celery sticks, bell pepper strips, or crusty bread

## Instructions

1. **Combine Cheeses:** In a medium bowl, combine the shredded sharp cheddar cheese and softened cream cheese.
2. **Add Mayonnaise & Pimentos:** Add the mayonnaise and drained diced pimentos to the bowl.
3. **Add Seasonings:** Pour in the pickled jalapeño juice (start with 1 tablespoon and add more if you prefer a tangier spread). Stir in the garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne pepper.
4. **Mix Thoroughly:** Using a fork or a sturdy spoon, mix all the ingredients until well combined and creamy. Some small lumps of cheese are fine and add texture.
5. **Season to Taste:** Taste the pimento cheese and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper as needed.
6. **Chill (Optional):** For best flavor and to allow the spread to firm up slightly, cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before serving.
7. **Serve:** Serve chilled with your favorite crackers, fresh vegetable sticks, or as a sandwich spread.

## Tips & Variations

- For a smoother spread, use an electric mixer to combine the ingredients.
- Experiment with different types of cheese, such as white cheddar, Monterey Jack, or a smoked cheddar for varying flavor profiles.
- Add finely minced green onions or chives for a fresh oniony kick.
- For extra heat, finely chop a few pickled jalapeño slices and add them directly to the spread.

## 👵 Grandma's Secret: Pimento Cheese Spread

> "Grandma Doris always added a tiny squeeze of fresh lemon juice (just about a teaspoon!) to her pimento cheese. 'It wakes up all the flavors,' she'd insist, 'and makes it taste extra bright and fresh, like sunshine in a bowl!'"

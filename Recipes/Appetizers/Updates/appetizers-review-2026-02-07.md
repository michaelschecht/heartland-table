## Critical Issues to Address

### Missing Images (High Priority)

Three recipes reference images that don't exist:

1. **beer-battered-fried-pickles.jpg** - Missing
2. **pimento-cheese-spread.jpg** - Missing
3. **spinach-artichoke-dip.jpg** - Missing

**Recommended Actions:**
- **Option A:** Generate AI images using nano-banana based on the photography notes
- **Option B:** Source or photograph real images
- **Option C:** Remove image references temporarily until images are available

---

## Consistency Improvements

### Standardize "At a Glance" Tables

Some recipes are missing fields:

- **Classic Deviled Eggs:** Missing "Total Time"
- **Wisconsin Fried Cheese Curds:** Missing "Total Time"

**Recommendation:** Ensure all "At a Glance" tables include:
- Servings
- Prep Time
- Cook Time
- **Total Time** (should include all passive time like chilling)
- Difficulty
- Category

## Recipe Content Quality

### Strengths Across All Recipes:
✅ Clear, numbered instructions  
✅ Complete ingredient lists with measurements  
✅ Excellent cultural context and history  
✅ Tips and variations sections  
✅ Photography notes for future image creation  
✅ Consistent formatting and structure  
✅ Midwest Nice Ratings and personality touches  
✅ Grandma's Secrets add character  

### Areas for Enhancement:
1. **Nutritional Information:** None of the recipes include calorie/nutrition data
2. **Dietary Tags:** Could add tags like "Vegetarian," "Gluten-Free Option," etc.
3. **Make-Ahead Notes:** Some recipes mention this, but not all
4. **Storage Instructions:** How long do leftovers keep?
5. **Scaling Notes:** Guidance for doubling or halving recipes

---

## Recommendations by Priority

### 🔴 High Priority
1. **Add or fix missing images** for beer-battered-fried-pickles, pimento-cheese-spread, and spinach-artichoke-dip
2. **Standardize "At a Glance" tables** to include Total Time field

### 🟡 Medium Priority
3. Add storage/refrigeration instructions where missing
4. Clarify timing inconsistencies (e.g., pimento cheese "15 minutes total" vs "chill 30 minutes")
5. Add safety notes for hot oil recipes

### 🟢 Low Priority / Nice to Have
6. Add nutritional information
7. Add dietary tags/filters
8. Include scaling notes for party sizes
9. Add seasonal/occasion tags (game day, potluck, holiday, etc.)

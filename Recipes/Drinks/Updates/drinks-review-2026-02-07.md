## Final Assessment

The **Drinks** section demonstrates some of the cookbook's finest cultural writing, particularly in the Wisconsin Brandy Old Fashioned and Homemade Root Beer recipes. These are not merely recipes—they are cultural artifacts that teach readers about regional identity, immigrant history, and the social rituals that define Midwestern life.

**However**, the image linking crisis significantly undermines the section's production quality. Half the recipes reference images that don't exist, while half the existing images are never referenced. This creates a confusing, unprofessional user experience that doesn't match the exceptional quality of the writing.

### If I Could Fix Only Three Things:
1. **Resolve all 4 image issues** (broken links + missing references)
2. **Add Midwest Nice Ratings to Lemonade and Hot Cider**
3. **Add Grandma's Secret sections to Lemonade and Hot Cider**

With these corrections, the Drinks section would rank among the cookbook's strongest offerings.

## Recipe Rankings (Quality + Cultural Depth)

1. **🥇 Wisconsin Brandy Old Fashioned** - Masterpiece of regional food writing
2. **🥈 Homemade Root Beer** - Exceptional safety guidance + cultural depth
3. **🥉 Hot Apple Cider** - Solid autumn classic, needs slight expansion
4. **Homemade Lemonade** - Good recipe, needs stronger Midwest identity

**Review Complete**  
**Next Recommended Actions:** Fix image references, add missing Midwest Nice Ratings, enhance Lemonade's regional specificity.

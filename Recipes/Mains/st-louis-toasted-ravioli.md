# St. Louis Toasted Ravioli

📍 *St. Louis, Missouri — The Hill Neighborhood*

> Not actually toasted but gloriously deep-fried, these crispy, golden pillows of meat-filled pasta are St. Louis's proudest happy accident — born on The Hill, served at every bar and restaurant in town, and utterly impossible to eat just one.

## Ingredients

### The Ravioli
- 1 package (25 ounces) frozen meat ravioli (do NOT thaw)
- 2 large eggs
- 1 cup whole milk
- 2 cups Italian-seasoned breadcrumbs
- ½ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- Vegetable or canola oil for frying (about 3 inches in a heavy pot)

### For Serving
- Warm marinara sauce for dipping
- Freshly grated Parmesan cheese for dusting
- Chopped fresh parsley

## Instructions

1. **Set up your breading station.** In a shallow bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk. In a separate shallow dish, combine the breadcrumbs, Parmesan, garlic powder, and black pepper.

2. **Bread the ravioli.** Working in batches, dip each frozen ravioli into the egg wash, letting the excess drip off, then press firmly into the breadcrumb mixture, coating both sides evenly. Place breaded ravioli on a wire rack or sheet pan. Let them sit for 5 minutes so the coating adheres.

3. **Heat the oil.** Pour oil into a heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven to a depth of about 3 inches. Heat to 350°F. Use a deep-fry or candy thermometer for accuracy — temperature control is key.

4. **Fry in batches.** Carefully lower 5–6 ravioli at a time into the hot oil. Don't overcrowd the pot. Fry for 2–3 minutes, turning once, until they're deeply golden brown and crispy all over.

5. **Drain.** Remove with a slotted spoon or spider strainer and drain on a wire rack set over a sheet pan (preferred over paper towels for maximum crispiness). Season immediately with a light dusting of Parmesan and salt while still hot.

6. **Serve hot.** Arrange on a platter, dust with more Parmesan and chopped parsley, and serve immediately with warm marinara sauce for dipping.

## Tips & Variations

- **Frozen is the way.** Using frozen (not thawed) ravioli is essential — they hold their shape during frying and the filling heats through without the pasta turning mushy.
- **Cheese Filling:** Substitute cheese ravioli for a vegetarian version. They fry up beautifully.
- **Air Fryer Method:** Spray breaded ravioli with cooking spray. Air fry at 400°F for 8–10 minutes, flipping halfway. Not quite the same as deep-fried, but a solid weeknight alternative.
- **Baked Version:** Place breaded ravioli on a greased sheet pan, mist with cooking spray, and bake at 425°F for 15–18 minutes, flipping once.
- **Provel Dip:** For true St. Louis authenticity, melt some Provel cheese into your marinara for a creamy, tangy dipping sauce.
- **Make It a Meal:** Serve a big platter as a main course alongside a simple green salad with Italian dressing.

## 🌾 Did You Know?

> The legend goes like this: sometime in the 1940s on The Hill — St. Louis's historic Italian-American neighborhood — a cook accidentally dropped a ravioli into the deep fryer instead of the boiling pasta water. Rather than toss it, someone tasted it, and a St. Louis icon was born. The two restaurants most often credited are Mama Campisi's and Charlie Gitto's, both on The Hill, though the true origin remains happily disputed. Today, "t-ravs" (as locals call them) appear on virtually every restaurant menu in St. Louis, from dive bars to white-tablecloth establishments. They're the official appetizer of Busch Stadium, and no Cardinals game is complete without a box of them. St. Louisans who move away consistently rank toasted ravioli as the food they miss most.

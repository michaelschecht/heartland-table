# Bratwurst with Sauerkraut

📍 *Wisconsin*

> In Wisconsin, bratwurst isn't just food. It's currency, ritual, and civic duty. You'll find brats simmering in beer and onions at every Lambeau Field tailgate, backyard cookout, firehouse fundraiser, and county fair from Green Bay to Milwaukee. The proper method is non-negotiable: boil first in beer, then char on the grill, then serve on a hard roll with sauerkraut, mustard, and nothing else unless you want an argument. Ketchup is treason. Buns are for hotdogs. This is Wisconsin law.

## Ingredients

**For the Brats:**
- 6 fresh (uncooked) bratwurst sausages (Johnsonville, Usinger's, or local butcher)
- 2 large yellow onions, sliced thick
- 3 cups (720ml) beer (cheap lager — save the craft beer for drinking)
- 1 cup (240ml) water
- 2 tbsp butter
- 1 tbsp brown sugar (optional, helps caramelize the onions)

**For the Sauerkraut:**
- 1 lb (450g) sauerkraut, drained and rinsed
- 1 apple (Granny Smith or Honeycrisp), peeled and diced (optional but encouraged)
- 1 tbsp butter
- 1 tsp caraway seeds (optional, traditional)
- ½ cup (120ml) of the beer from boiling the brats

**For Serving:**
- 6 hard rolls or semmel buns (NOT hotdog buns)
- Yellow mustard or spicy brown mustard
- Diced raw onion (optional)

## Instructions

1. **Simmer the Brats:** In a large pot or Dutch oven, combine the beer, water, sliced onions, and butter. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Add the bratwurst and reduce heat to low. Simmer gently (do NOT boil) for 15-20 minutes, turning occasionally. The brats should be cooked through but not burst. Reserve the beer-onion mixture.

2. **Prepare the Sauerkraut:** While the brats simmer, melt 1 tbsp butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the drained sauerkraut, diced apple (if using), caraway seeds, and ½ cup of the beer-onion liquid from the brats. Simmer for 10-15 minutes until the flavors meld and the sauerkraut is tender. Keep warm.

3. **Grill the Brats:** Preheat a grill (or grill pan) to medium-high heat. Remove the brats from the beer bath and place them on the grill. Char on all sides until the casings are crispy and darkened, about 3-5 minutes per side. You want deep grill marks and a good snap when you bite into them.

4. **Caramelize the Onions (Optional but Encouraged):** Strain the onions from the beer bath. Heat a skillet over medium heat with a bit of butter or oil. Add the beer-soaked onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until caramelized and golden, about 5-7 minutes. Sprinkle with brown sugar if you want extra sweetness.

5. **Serve:** Place each grilled brat in a hard roll. Top with a generous spoonful of warm sauerkraut and caramelized onions. Add mustard. Serve immediately. Eat standing up. Argue about football.

## Tips & Variations

- **The Beer Bath is Law:** Never skip simmering the brats in beer. It keeps them juicy and infuses flavor. The grill is for texture, not cooking.
- **Cheese Brats:** For an even more Wisconsin experience, use cheddar-stuffed bratwurst.
- **Apple in Sauerkraut:** Diced apple (or a spoonful of apple jelly) cuts the tang of the sauerkraut and adds subtle sweetness. This is a German-Midwest tradition.
- **Hard Rolls Only:** Wisconsin brats are served on hard rolls or semmel buns, not soft hotdog buns. The roll should have structure and a slight chew.
- **Leftovers:** Chop leftover brats and add them to scrambled eggs, mac and cheese, or potato soup.

## 🌾 Did You Know?

> Wisconsin's love affair with bratwurst began in the 1800s when German immigrants settled in Milwaukee, Sheboygan, and surrounding areas. Butchers like Usinger's (est. 1880) and Johnsonville (est. 1945) turned bratwurst into a regional icon. Today, Wisconsin consumes more brats per capita than any other state.
> 
> The tradition of boiling brats in beer before grilling became standard practice at Lambeau Field tailgates in the 1960s. The method keeps the sausages moist while adding flavor from the beer and onions. The final char on the grill adds texture and a smoky crust. It's a two-step process that Wisconsin takes seriously.
> 
> Sheboygan calls itself the "Bratwurst Capital of the World" and holds an annual Bratwurst Festival. Milwaukee's State Fair sells more than 200,000 brats during its 11-day run. And at Lambeau Field, you're not a real Packers fan unless you've eaten a brat in the parking lot at 8 a.m. in subzero temperatures.

*📸 Photography note: Tailgate realism. A charred bratwurst in a hard roll on a paper plate, piled high with sauerkraut and caramelized onions, a squiggle of yellow mustard. Background: a Weber grill with more brats, a cooler, and a blurred Wisconsin flag or Packers logo. Shot outdoors in natural afternoon light. The vibe should be parking lot, not fine dining.*

## 👵 Grandma's Secret: Bratwurst with Sauerkraut

> "Grandma Schmidt, who grew up in Sheboygan, always added a spoonful of apple jelly to the sauerkraut while it simmered. 'Cuts the sour, makes it sing,' she'd say with a wink. She also insisted on using cheap beer for boiling — 'Miller High Life or nothing. Save the good beer for drinking.' And if anyone put ketchup on a brat at her table, they were politely asked to leave."

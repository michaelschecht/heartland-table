# Mains Section Review - Heartland Table Cookbook
**Date:** February 7, 2026  
**Section:** Mains (27 recipes)  
**Reviewer:** Subagent Review Process

---

## Executive Summary

The Mains section contains 27 recipes representing the heartland of Midwest cuisine. Quality is **highly variable** - ranging from exceptional, narrative-driven Chicago recipes to bare-bones template entries that lack the cookbook's signature voice. **14 of 27 recipes (52%) are missing images**. Two distinct writing styles are evident: a witty, deeply researched narrative voice (Chicago/Detroit/Kansas City entries) and a generic, flat "recipe card" voice (most other entries).

## Conclusion

The Mains section demonstrates the cookbook's **potential** with 10 exceptional recipes that showcase brilliant narrative voice, deep cultural research, and regional personality. However, 52% of the section consists of generic template entries that undermine the cookbook's unique value proposition.

**The split is stark:** City-specific recipes (Chicago, Detroit, KC, St. Louis) are publication-ready. Generic "Midwest US" and weakly-tagged state recipes need substantial revision or removal.

**Priority:** Resolve image gap, eliminate duplicate content, and rewrite or cut the 14 weak recipes. The cookbook should maintain the high standard set by the Chicago/Detroit entries throughout.

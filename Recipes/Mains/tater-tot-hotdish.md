# Tater Tot Hotdish

📍 *Minnesota*

> The crown jewel of Minnesota cuisine. Don't call it a casserole — in Minnesota, it's a *hotdish*, and that distinction matters. Layers of ground beef, creamy soup, vegetables, and a golden crown of tater tots. It's comfort food elevated to cultural identity.

## Ingredients

- 1½ lbs ground beef (80/20)
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 can (10.5 oz) cream of mushroom soup
- 1 can (10.5 oz) cream of chicken soup
- ½ cup whole milk

- 2 cups shredded cheddar cheese
- 1 bag (32 oz) frozen tater tots
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce

## Instructions

1. **Preheat** oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease a 9×13-inch baking dish.
2. **Brown the beef:** In a large skillet over medium-high, cook ground beef and onion until beef is browned and onion is soft, about 8 minutes. Add garlic, cook 1 minute. Drain excess fat.
3. **Make the filling:** Stir in both soups, milk, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper. Fold in frozen vegetables.
4. **Layer:** Spread meat mixture evenly in the baking dish. Sprinkle cheese on top. Arrange tater tots in a single layer over the cheese — neat rows for the perfectionists, scattered for the rebels.
5. **Bake** uncovered for 45–50 minutes until tots are golden and crispy and filling is bubbling around the edges.
6. **Rest** 5 minutes before serving straight from the dish.

## Tips & Variations

- **The tot arrangement debate:** Some families insist on perfect rows. Others dump and spread. Both camps are correct. This is a judgment-free hotdish zone.
- **Cream soup swap:** For a from-scratch version, make a quick mushroom béchamel instead of canned soup.
- **Protein alternatives:** Ground turkey, leftover roast beef, or even wild rice for vegetarian.
- **Extra crispy tots:** Broil for the last 2–3 minutes. Watch carefully.
- **The church basement method:** Double the recipe. Use a full-size aluminum pan. Feed 30 people. Accept compliments.

## 🌾 Did You Know?

"Hotdish" is a distinctly Minnesotan term — and Minnesotans will politely but firmly correct you if you call it a casserole. The word has been in use since at least the 1930s, and the tater tot version became the definitive hotdish after Ore-Ida introduced frozen tater tots in 1956. In 2022, Minnesota declared tater tot hotdish the official state dish. There's even an annual "Hotdish Cook-Off" at the Minnesota State Capitol, where legislators compete with their personal recipes. Former Senator Al Franken was known to be a serious hotdish competitor.

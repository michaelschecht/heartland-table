# Chicago-Style Hot Dog

📍 *Chicago, Illinois — Vienna Beef Territory*

> An all-beef frankfurter nestled in a steamed poppy seed bun, dragged through the garden with yellow mustard, bright green relish, chopped onion, tomato wedges, a dill pickle spear, sport peppers, and a dash of celery salt. Everything but ketchup. **Never ketchup.** This isn't a suggestion. This is constitutional law in Chicago.

## 🫕 Midwest Nice Rating: 🫕🫕🫕

Perfectly welcome at a cookout, but this is street food — it's meant to be eaten standing up at a neon-lit stand, dripping onto your shirt.

## Ingredients

### The Dog
- 8 all-beef hot dogs (Vienna Beef if you can get them — this is the canonical Chicago choice)
- 8 poppy seed hot dog buns (steamed, not toasted)

### The Seven Toppings (In Order)
1. Yellow mustard
2. Sweet neon-green relish (Chicago-style — the unnaturally green kind)
3. Chopped white onion
4. 2 ripe tomatoes, cut into wedges
5. 8 dill pickle spears
6. 16 sport peppers (2 per dog)
7. Celery salt

### Absolutely NOT
- ~~Ketchup~~. Don't even think about it.

## Instructions

1. **Cook the dogs.** Bring a pot of water to a gentle boil, reduce to a simmer, and add the hot dogs. Cook for 4–5 minutes until heated through and plump. (Alternatively, grill them — Chicagoans debate this, but both methods are accepted.) Do not microwave them. We're not animals.

2. **Steam the buns.** While the dogs cook, steam the poppy seed buns. You can set them over the simmering water on a steamer basket, wrap them in a damp paper towel and microwave for 15 seconds, or briefly warm them in a low oven wrapped in foil. The bun should be warm and soft, not toasted. Toasting the bun is a New York thing. We don't do that here.

3. **Assemble in order.** Place a hot dog in each bun. Then, and this part matters:
   - **First:** A stripe of yellow mustard down one side of the dog.
   - **Second:** Sweet green relish down the other side.
   - **Third:** Chopped white onion, scattered generously.
   - **Fourth:** Two tomato wedges, tucked between the dog and the bun.
   - **Fifth:** A dill pickle spear, laid lengthwise alongside the dog.
   - **Sixth:** Two sport peppers, placed on top.
   - **Seventh:** A generous dash of celery salt over the whole thing.

4. **Eat immediately.** Do not put this on a plate with a knife and fork. Hold it with two hands. Accept the mess. This is the Chicago way.

## Tips & Variations

- **Vienna Beef or Bust:** In Chicago, Vienna Beef is the standard. If you're outside Chicago and can't get them, look for any all-beef, natural-casing hot dog with good snap. Nathan's works. Hebrew National works. A turkey dog does not work. Go home.
- **The Neon Relish:** Chicago-style relish is sweet pickle relish dyed an almost radioactive green. It's available online and at specialty stores. Regular sweet relish works flavor-wise, but the color won't be right, and Chicagoans will know.
- **Sport Peppers:** These small, pickled, moderately hot peppers are essential. They're sold in jars (Marconi and Vienna brands are common). If you truly can't find them, pepperoncini are a passable substitute — but it's not the same. The sport pepper has a specific vinegary heat that defines the Chicago dog.
- **The Ketchup Rule:** Look, if you're over the age of 12, do not put ketchup on a Chicago-style hot dog. This is not snobbery. It's civic duty. The sweetness of ketchup overwhelms the carefully balanced flavors of the seven toppings. If you want ketchup, that's fine — just don't call it a Chicago dog. And maybe don't mention it to anyone from Chicago.
- **Char Dog Variation:** Some stands char-grill the dog and split it down the middle. This gives you a snappier, smokier dog that holds up to the mountain of toppings. Perfectly legitimate.

> **🤫 Grandma's Secret:** *"The tomato wedges should be placed between the dog and the bun, not on top. They act as a structural support for everything else. Also, use the celery salt last — it ties everything together the way salt ties together any dish. Most people undershake. Don't undershake."*

## Pairs Well With

A Maxwell Street Polish sausage for your other hand, a bag of Jay's hot stuff potato chips, standing on a sidewalk at 11 PM after a Cubs loss, and the absolute certainty that this is the greatest hot dog in America (New York is wrong, and deep down they know it).

## 🌾 Did You Know?

> The Chicago-style hot dog was born during the Great Depression, when pushcart vendors — many of them Greek and Eastern European immigrants — sold cheap all-beef frankfurters loaded with free vegetable toppings to make the meal seem more substantial. The generous pile of onions, tomatoes, relish, and pickles turned a five-cent hot dog into a complete meal for people who couldn't afford much else. The Vienna Beef company, founded in 1893 by Austrian-Hungarian immigrants Emil Reichel and Sam Ladany (who debuted their sausages at the Chicago World's Fair), became the city's dominant hot dog brand. By mid-century, the "Chicago-style" formula had codified into the seven-topping standard we know today. There are an estimated 1,800 hot dog stands in Chicago — more than the city's McDonald's, Burger King, and Wendy's locations combined. The hot dog isn't just Chicago food. It's Chicago infrastructure.

*📸 Photography note: A Chicago dog in all its glory — the neon green relish, the yellow mustard stripe, the bright red tomato wedges, the pickle spear running the length of the bun, the sport peppers perched on top, celery salt visible, poppy seed bun — in a red-and-white checkered paper boat. Maybe a hand holding it with the Chicago skyline soft in the background. Or a neon hot dog stand sign. The colors should pop. This is not a subtle food.*

- ½ cup milk (whole or 2%)
- 4-6 cups vegetable oil or shortening, for frying

**For the Cream Gravy:**

## Instructions

1. **Prepare Steak:** Pat the cube steaks dry with paper towels. Season both sides generously with salt and black pepper. If using top round, pound it to about ¼-inch thickness.
2. **Set Up Breading Station:** Set up three shallow dishes. In the first dish, whisk together 1 cup of flour, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne pepper (if using). In the second dish, whisk together the eggs and ½ cup milk. In the third dish, place the remaining ½ cup of flour.
3. **Dredge Steaks:** Dredge each steak first in the seasoned flour, shaking off excess. Then dip it into the egg wash, ensuring it's fully coated. Finally, return it to the seasoned flour for a second coating, pressing gently to adhere the breading. Place breaded steaks on a wire rack while you prepare the others.
4. **Heat Oil:** In a large, heavy-bottomed skillet (preferably cast iron), add vegetable oil or shortening to a depth of about 1 inch. Heat over medium-high heat until it reaches 350°F (175°C).
5. **Fry Steaks:** Carefully place 1-2 breaded steaks into the hot oil (do not overcrowd the pan). Fry for 3-5 minutes per side, or until deeply golden brown and crispy. The internal temperature should reach 145°F (63°C).
6. **Drain:** Using tongs, remove the fried steaks and place them on a clean wire rack set over paper towels to drain excess oil. Keep warm in a low oven (200°F / 95°C) while you make the gravy.
7. **Make Cream Gravy:** Carefully pour off all but ¼ cup of the pan drippings from the skillet. Return the skillet to medium heat. Whisk in ¼ cup flour and cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly, until a light golden roux forms. Slowly whisk in the warmed milk, stirring constantly to prevent lumps. Bring the gravy to a simmer, whisking until it thickens. Season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of cayenne pepper (if using) to taste.
8. **Serve:** Serve the hot, crispy chicken fried steaks immediately, smothered generously with the warm cream gravy. Excellent with mashed potatoes and green beans.

## Tips & Variations

- For extra tender steak, pound the cube steaks even thinner before breading.
- Use bacon fat instead of vegetable oil for frying for an extra layer of savory flavor.
- For spicier gravy, add a dash of hot sauce or more cayenne pepper.
- Serve with a side of creamy mashed potatoes and steamed green beans or corn for a classic Southern-Midwestern meal.

## 👵 Grandma's Secret: Chicken Fried Steak

> "Grandma Loretta swore by soaking her cube steaks in buttermilk for at least an hour (or even overnight!) before breading. 'It makes 'em so tender,' she'd declare, 'you'll think you're eating prime rib, bless your heart!'"

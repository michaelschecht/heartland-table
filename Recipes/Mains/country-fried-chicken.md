## Ingredients

- 2-3 lbs (900g-1.3kg) bone-in, skin-on chicken pieces (drumsticks, thighs, breasts, wings)
- 2 cups (480ml) buttermilk
- 1 tsp hot sauce (optional, for flavor, not heat)
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 tbsp cornstarch (for extra crispiness)
- 1 tbsp salt

- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp onion powder
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- ½ tsp cayenne pepper (optional, for a kick)
- 4-6 cups vegetable oil or shortening, for frying

## Instructions

1. **Marinate Chicken:** In a large bowl, combine buttermilk and hot sauce (if using). Add chicken pieces, ensuring they are fully submerged. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 2 hours, to tenderize and add flavor.
2. **Prepare Breading:** In a shallow dish or a large zip-top bag, whisk together flour, cornstarch, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika, and cayenne pepper (if using).
3. **Bread Chicken:** Remove chicken pieces from the buttermilk, allowing excess to drip off. Do not rinse. Dredge each piece thoroughly in the seasoned flour mixture, pressing to ensure a thick, even coating. Place breaded chicken on a wire rack set over a baking sheet.
4. **Heat Oil:** In a large, heavy-bottomed skillet (preferably cast iron) or Dutch oven, add vegetable oil or shortening to a depth of about 1.5-2 inches. Heat over medium-high heat until it reaches 350°F (175°C). Use a deep-fry thermometer to monitor the temperature.
5. **Fry Chicken:** Carefully place chicken pieces into the hot oil, skin-side down first (do not overcrowd the pan; fry in batches). Fry for 6-8 minutes per side, turning with tongs, until golden brown.
6. **Cook Through:** Reduce heat to medium-low, cover the skillet, and continue to cook for an additional 10-15 minutes, flipping once or twice, until the chicken is cooked through and the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C) at the thickest part.
7. **Drain & Serve:** Remove fried chicken from the skillet and place on a clean wire rack set over paper towels to drain excess oil. Let rest for a few minutes. Serve hot, often with country gravy.

## Tips & Variations

- For extra crispy chicken, you can do a double-dredge: after the first flour coating, dip back into a shallow bowl of buttermilk, then dredge in flour again.
- Use a mix of dark and white meat chicken pieces to cater to different preferences.
- If the chicken is browning too quickly, lower the heat slightly. If it's not browning, increase the heat. Maintaining a consistent oil temperature is key.
- Serve with a side of creamy mashed potatoes, green beans, or coleslaw for a classic Midwestern meal.

*📸 Photography note: Rustic farmhouse style. A platter piled high with golden-brown, crispy country fried chicken pieces, glistening and hot. A small bowl of creamy white country gravy is nearby. Set on a well-worn wooden table, perhaps with a classic checkered tablecloth, bathed in soft, inviting natural light. Focus on the appealing crispiness of the chicken.*

## 👵 Grandma's Secret: Country Fried Chicken

> "Grandma Irene always added a secret spoonful of **sugar** (just a teaspoon!) to her flour dredge. 'It helps the chicken get that perfect golden crust,' she'd whisper, 'and makes it extra crispy, a little trick no one ever guesses!'"

## Ingredients

- 1 (7-9 lb / 3.1-4 kg) pre-cooked spiral-sliced ham
- 1 (12 oz / 340g) jar cherry preserves or jam
- ½ cup (120ml) honey
- ¼ cup (60ml) fresh orange juice (or cherry juice)
- 1 tbsp (15ml) apple cider vinegar
- 1 tsp Dijon mustard
- ½ tsp ground ginger
- ¼ tsp ground cloves
- Pinch of salt and black pepper

## Instructions

1. **Preheat Oven & Prepare Ham:** Preheat your oven to 325°F (160°C). Place the ham in a large roasting pan, fat-side up. If your ham didn't come with glaze instructions, you can add about ½ inch of water to the bottom of the pan to help keep it moist.
2. **Make Cherry Glaze:** In a medium saucepan, combine the cherry preserves, honey, orange juice, apple cider vinegar, Dijon mustard, ground ginger, ground cloves, salt, and black pepper. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the preserves have melted and the glaze is smooth (about 5-7 minutes).
3. **First Glaze Application:** Bake the ham for 1 to 1.5 hours, or according to package directions, until it is warmed through (internal temperature of 140°F / 60°C). During the last 30 minutes of baking, begin applying the glaze.
4. **Continue Glazing:** Increase oven temperature to 375°F (190°C). Brush about one-third of the cherry glaze generously over the ham. Return to the oven and bake for 10-15 minutes.
5. **Final Glazing:** Repeat the glazing process two more times, brushing the ham with additional glaze every 10-15 minutes, until all the glaze is used and the ham is beautifully caramelized and glossy.
6. **Rest & Serve:** Remove the ham from the oven and tent loosely with foil. Let it rest for 10-15 minutes before carving and serving. This allows the juices to redistribute and ensures a moist ham.

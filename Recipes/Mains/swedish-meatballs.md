## Ingredients

**For the Meatballs:**
- 1 lb (450g) ground beef (80/20 recommended)
- ½ lb (225g) ground pork
- ½ cup (40g) breadcrumbs (Panko or fresh)
- ¼ cup (60ml) milk or cream
- 1 small onion, finely minced and sautéed until softened
- 1 large egg, lightly beaten
- 1 tsp salt
- ½ tsp black pepper
- ¼ tsp ground allspice
- ⅛ tsp ground nutmeg

**For the Gravy:**
- 2 tbsp (30g) unsalted butter
- 2 tbsp (15g) all-purpose flour
- 2 cups (480ml) beef broth
- ½ cup (120ml) heavy cream or half-and-half
- 1 tbsp (15ml) Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tbsp (15g) Dijon mustard
- Salt and black pepper to taste

**For Serving:**
- Cooked egg noodles or mashed potatoes
- Lingonberry preserves (optional)
- Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)

## Instructions

1. **Prepare Meatballs:** In a large bowl, gently combine ground beef, ground pork, breadcrumbs, milk (or cream), sautéed minced onion, egg, salt, pepper, allspice, and nutmeg. Mix until just combined – do not overmix, or meatballs will be tough.
2. **Form Meatballs:** Roll the mixture into small, 1-inch (2.5 cm) meatballs. You should get about 30-35 meatballs.
3. **Cook Meatballs:** Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add a tablespoon of oil if needed. Brown the meatballs in batches until seared on all sides. They don't need to be cooked through. Remove meatballs from skillet and set aside.
4. **Make Roux:** In the same skillet (don't drain the drippings), melt butter over medium heat. Whisk in flour and cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly, until a light roux forms.
5. **Whisk in Liquids:** Slowly whisk in the beef broth, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Bring to a simmer, whisking until the gravy thickens. Reduce heat to low.
6. **Finish Gravy:** Stir in the heavy cream, Worcestershire sauce, and Dijon mustard. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Return the browned meatballs to the gravy. Cover and simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until meatballs are cooked through and flavors have melded.
7. **Serve:** Serve hot over cooked egg noodles or creamy mashed potatoes. Garnish with fresh chopped parsley and a dollop of lingonberry preserves on the side, if desired.

## Tips & Variations

- For a richer flavor, use a mix of beef and veal instead of pork.
- If you prefer a less creamy gravy, you can reduce the amount of heavy cream and use more beef broth.
- Make ahead: Meatballs can be cooked and stored in the gravy in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on the stovetop.
- Serve with pickled cucumbers for an authentic Scandinavian touch.

### 👵 Grandma's Secret: Swedish Meatballs

> "Grandma Svennson always snuck in a tiny pinch of ground cardamom into her meatballs. 'Just a whisper,' she'd say, 'to make them taste like home.' It added a subtle, warm complexity no one could quite pinpoint but everyone loved."

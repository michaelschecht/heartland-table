## Instructions

1. **Sauté the aromatics.** In a large Dutch oven or heavy pot, melt butter over medium heat. Add onion and carrots. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 8–10 minutes until softened and the onion is translucent.

2. **Add garlic and tomato paste.** Add garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Stir in tomato paste and cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly, to caramelize it slightly and deepen the flavor.

3. **Add tomatoes and broth.** Pour in the canned tomatoes with their juices, crushing them with your hands or a spoon as you add them. Add broth, sugar, salt, pepper, dried basil, oregano, and bay leaf. Stir to combine.

4. **Simmer.** Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Simmer uncovered for 20–25 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the carrots are very tender and the flavors have melded.

5. **Remove bay leaf and blend.** Discard the bay leaf. Using an immersion blender, blend the soup directly in the pot until completely smooth. (Alternatively, carefully transfer in batches to a blender, blend until smooth, and return to the pot.)

6. **Add the cream.** Reduce heat to low. Stir in heavy cream until fully incorporated. Taste and adjust seasoning — add more sugar if too acidic, more salt if flat.

7. **Serve.** Ladle into bowls. Drizzle with a swirl of cream, scatter fresh basil on top, and serve immediately with grilled cheese sandwiches for dipping.

## Tips & Variations

- **San Marzano Tomatoes:** These Italian plum tomatoes are sweeter and less acidic than regular canned tomatoes. They make a noticeable difference. If unavailable, use the best quality whole peeled tomatoes you can find.
- **Roasted Tomato Version:** In summer, use 3 pounds fresh tomatoes, halved and roasted at 400°F for 30 minutes until caramelized. Proceed with the recipe.
- **Dairy-Free:** Substitute coconut cream for heavy cream, or omit entirely for a lighter soup.
- **Smoky Twist:** Add ½ teaspoon smoked paprika and a chipotle pepper in adobo.
- **Grilled Cheese Croutons:** Cut grilled cheese sandwiches into cubes and float them on top.
- **Slow Cooker:** Combine all ingredients except cream in a slow cooker. Cook on low for 6–8 hours. Blend, then stir in cream.
- **Freezer Friendly:** Freeze without the cream. When reheating, warm the soup and stir in fresh cream.

## 🌾 Did You Know?

> Cream of tomato soup became an American icon thanks to Dr. John T. Dorrance, who invented condensed soup for Campbell's in 1897. The famous red-and-white can became so ubiquitous that Andy Warhol immortalized it in his 1962 pop art series. But generations of Midwestern cooks knew that homemade was better. Farm wives would can summer tomatoes specifically for winter soup-making, adding cream from their dairy cows for richness. The pairing with grilled cheese sandwiches likely emerged during the Great Depression when both foods were cheap and filling. Today, this duo remains the ultimate comfort food combination — a taste of childhood in every bowl.

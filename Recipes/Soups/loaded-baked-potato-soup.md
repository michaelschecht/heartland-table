## Instructions

1. **Cook the potatoes.** Place potato cubes in a large pot and cover with cold, salted water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce to a simmer. Cook for 15–20 minutes until fork-tender. Drain and set aside.

2. **Cook the bacon.** While potatoes cook, arrange bacon in a single layer in a large Dutch oven or heavy pot. Cook over medium heat, flipping occasionally, until crispy, about 8–10 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Crumble when cool. Reserve 2 tablespoons of bacon fat in the pot.

3. **Build the base.** Add butter to the bacon fat and melt over medium heat. Add onion and cook until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

4. **Make the roux.** Sprinkle flour over the onions and stir constantly for 2 minutes to cook out the raw flour taste.

5. **Add the liquids.** Gradually pour in chicken broth, whisking constantly to prevent lumps. Add milk and heavy cream. Bring to a gentle simmer.

6. **Add the potatoes.** Add the cooked potatoes to the pot. Using a potato masher or the back of a wooden spoon, mash about half of the potatoes to thicken the soup while leaving chunks for texture.

7. **Finish the soup.** Stir in sour cream, salt, pepper, and smoked paprika. Simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until thick and creamy. Adjust seasoning to taste.

8. **Serve loaded.** Ladle soup into bowls. Top each serving generously with shredded cheddar, crumbled bacon, a dollop of sour cream, and a shower of fresh chives.

## Tips & Variations

- **Potato Choice:** Russets are starchier and break down beautifully to thicken the soup. Yukon Golds work but stay chunkier.
- **Texture Control:** Mash more potatoes for a thicker soup, fewer for a chunkier version. You can also blend part of the soup for ultra-creamy consistency.
- **Slow Cooker:** Sauté onion and garlic, make the roux, then transfer everything to a slow cooker. Cook on low for 6–8 hours.
- **Vegetarian Version:** Skip the bacon, use vegetable broth, and top with vegetarian bacon bits.
- **Extra Cheesy:** Stir 1 cup shredded cheddar directly into the soup before serving.
- **Broccoli Addition:** Add 2 cups steamed broccoli florets for a broccoli-potato hybrid.
- **Make It Lighter:** Substitute half-and-half for heavy cream and use reduced-fat sour cream.

## 🌾 Did You Know?

> Loaded baked potato soup emerged as a restaurant favorite in the 1980s, combining the Midwest's two great loves: potatoes and soup. Idaho and the upper Midwest grow vast quantities of russet potatoes, making them an everyday staple. The "loaded" part — bacon, cheese, sour cream, and chives — mirrors the toppings on a classic steakhouse baked potato. This soup became a church supper and potluck favorite because it's easy to make in large batches and everyone loves it. On a freezing January day in Minnesota or Iowa, there's nothing more comforting than a steaming bowl of this golden goodness.

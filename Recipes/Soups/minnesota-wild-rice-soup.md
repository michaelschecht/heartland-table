📍 *Minnesota*

> This soup tastes like a Minnesota lake country November: earthy wild rice harvested from northern waters, cream as thick as fog over the Iron Range, and the kind of warmth that makes you grateful for a cabin with a woodstove. It's the soup Minnesotans serve to out-of-state guests to explain why they endure six-month winters — one bowl, and you get it.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup (170g) wild rice, rinsed
- 6 cups (1.4L) chicken broth, divided
- 2 tbsp (30g) unsalted butter
- 1 large yellow onion, finely chopped
- 2 carrots, peeled and diced
- 2 celery stalks, diced
- 8 oz (225g) sliced fresh mushrooms (cremini or white button)
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- ½ cup (60g) all-purpose flour
- 2 cups (480ml) milk or half-and-half, warmed
- 1 cup (240ml) heavy cream
- 2 cups (300g) cooked chicken, shredded or diced
- ½ tsp dried thyme
- ½ tsp dried sage
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- Fresh parsley, chopped, for garnish (optional)

## Instructions

1. **Cook Wild Rice:** In a medium saucepan, combine the rinsed wild rice with 3 cups of chicken broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 35-45 minutes, or until the wild rice is tender and has "flowered" (opened up). Drain any excess liquid and set aside.
2. **Sauté Vegetables:** While the rice cooks, melt butter in a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Add chopped onion, carrots, and celery. Cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 8-10 minutes. Add sliced mushrooms and continue to cook until they release their liquid and begin to brown, about 5-7 minutes. Stir in minced garlic and cook for 1 minute more until fragrant.
3. **Make Roux:** Sprinkle flour over the cooked vegetables and stir constantly for 1-2 minutes to create a light golden roux.
4. **Add Liquids:** Gradually whisk in the remaining 3 cups of chicken broth, stirring constantly to prevent lumps. Bring the mixture to a simmer, whisking until it thickens.
5. **Add Dairy & Seasonings:** Reduce heat to low. Slowly whisk in the warmed milk (or half-and-half) and heavy cream. Stir in the cooked wild rice, cooked chicken, dried thyme, and dried sage.
6. **Simmer & Season:** Let the soup simmer gently for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, to allow the flavors to meld and the soup to heat through completely. Taste and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper as needed.
7. **Serve:** Ladle the hot Minnesota Wild Rice Soup into bowls. Garnish with fresh chopped parsley, if desired. Serve immediately.

## Tips & Variations

- For a vegetarian version, omit the chicken and use vegetable broth, adding extra mushrooms or other vegetables.
- Add a splash of dry sherry or white wine to the vegetables before adding the broth for an extra layer of complexity.
- If you prefer a thicker soup, you can reduce the amount of milk slightly or increase the flour in the roux.
- Make ahead: The soup (without the cream) can be made a day in advance. Add the cream and chicken when reheating gently on the stovetop.

## 🌾 Did You Know?

> Wild rice, or *Zizania aquatica*, is not actually a rice but the seed of an aquatic grass native to the Great Lakes region, especially Minnesota. It holds deep cultural significance for Indigenous communities and is Minnesota's official state grain. Minnesota Wild Rice Soup is a beloved dish that showcases this unique grain, offering a nutty flavor and chewy texture that epitomizes the state's natural bounty and comforting, hearty cuisine, particularly popular during the long, cold winters.

*📸 Photography note: Rustic farmhouse style. A deep, wide ceramic bowl filled with creamy Minnesota Wild Rice Soup, showcasing the dark wild rice grains, tender chicken, and colorful vegetables. A garnish of fresh parsley. The bowl sits on a wooden table, possibly with a subtly patterned tablecloth, bathed in soft, natural overhead lighting. A vintage spoon resting in the bowl enhances the cozy feel.*

## 👵 Grandma's Secret: Minnesota Wild Rice Soup

> "Grandma Ingrid always added a tiny splash of dry sherry (about a tablespoon!) to her soup right before adding the cream. 'It just makes the flavors sing,' she'd say, 'like a choir of angels, don't you know!'"

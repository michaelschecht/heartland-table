## Instructions

1. **Cook the sausage.** In a large skillet over medium-high heat, cook the breakfast sausage, breaking it into crumbles with a wooden spoon, until browned and cooked through, about 6–8 minutes. Transfer to a bowl lined with paper towels and set aside. Wipe out the skillet.

2. **Crisp the hash browns.** Add vegetable oil to the same skillet over medium-high heat. Add hash browns and spread into an even layer. Cook without stirring for 3–4 minutes until the bottom is golden and crispy. Flip and cook another 3–4 minutes. Season with a pinch of salt. Transfer to a bowl.

3. **Sauté the vegetables.** Add a drizzle of oil to the skillet if needed. Sauté bell peppers and onion over medium heat until softened and slightly caramelized, about 4–5 minutes. Transfer to a bowl.

4. **Scramble the eggs.** In a medium bowl, whisk eggs with milk, salt, and pepper. Melt butter in the skillet over medium-low heat. Pour in egg mixture. Cook slowly, gently folding and stirring with a spatula, until eggs are just set but still creamy, about 4–5 minutes. Remove from heat immediately — they'll continue cooking from residual heat.

5. **Warm the tortillas.** Wrap tortillas in damp paper towels and microwave for 30–45 seconds until pliable. Or warm them one at a time in a dry skillet for 15 seconds per side.

6. **Assemble.** Lay a warmed tortilla flat. Spoon a line of eggs down the center, leaving 2 inches at the top and bottom. Top with sausage, hash browns, peppers and onions, and a generous handful of cheese. Don't overfill — you need room to fold.

7. **Fold the burrito.** Fold the sides of the tortilla in over the filling. Then, starting from the bottom, roll the burrito up tightly, keeping the sides tucked in as you go.

8. **Optional crisp.** For a crispy exterior, place the burrito seam-side down in a dry skillet over medium heat. Cook for 1–2 minutes until golden. Flip and repeat.

9. **Serve hot.** Cut in half on a diagonal and serve with your favorite toppings.

## Tips & Variations

- **Freezer Friendly:** Wrap assembled burritos individually in foil, then place in a freezer bag. Freeze for up to 3 months. To reheat: unwrap, wrap in a damp paper towel, and microwave for 2–3 minutes, flipping halfway. Or bake from frozen at 350°F for 25–30 minutes.
- **Bacon Version:** Substitute crumbled crispy bacon for the sausage.
- **Veggie Burritos:** Skip the sausage and add black beans, spinach, and extra peppers.
- **Spicy Kick:** Add diced jalapeños to the sauté, or mix hot sauce into the eggs.
- **Low-Carb:** Use large lettuce leaves or low-carb tortillas instead.
- **Cheese Choices:** Pepper Jack adds heat; Colby Jack melts beautifully; mix cheeses for more complexity.
- **Make It Saucier:** Drizzle chipotle mayo or green chile sauce inside before rolling.

## 🌾 Did You Know?

> The breakfast burrito as we know it originated in the American Southwest, but the Midwest enthusiastically adopted it as the perfect farm-country fuel. Hearty, portable, and endlessly customizable, it fit right into the Heartland's grab-and-go culture. School mornings, early shifts, and long drives all called for something more substantial than a granola bar. The freezer-friendly version became a Midwestern mom's secret weapon — prep once, eat all week. Some families have their own signature versions passed down through generations, with debates about sausage vs. bacon as heated as any political discussion.

## Instructions

1. **Prepare Biscuits:** Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Cut in the cold butter with a pastry blender or your fingertips until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add buttermilk, stirring with a fork until a shaggy dough forms.
2. **Form Biscuits:** Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Gently knead 5-6 times until it just comes together. Pat or roll dough to about ¾-inch thickness. Use a 2.5-inch (6 cm) biscuit cutter to cut out biscuits. Reroll scraps once. Place biscuits on an ungreased baking sheet, close together for softer sides or slightly apart for crispier sides. Brush tops with extra buttermilk.
3. **Bake Biscuits:** Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until golden brown and puffed.
4. **Cook Sausage:** While biscuits bake, crumble breakfast sausage into a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook, breaking up with a spoon, until browned and cooked through. Do not drain all the fat; leave about ¼ cup of drippings in the pan for the gravy.
5. **Make Roux for Gravy:** Reduce heat to medium. Sprinkle flour over the cooked sausage and drippings. Cook, stirring constantly, for 1-2 minutes until a light golden roux forms.
6. **Add Milk & Thicken:** Slowly whisk in the warmed milk, stirring constantly to prevent lumps. Bring to a simmer, whisking frequently, until the gravy thickens to your desired consistency (about 5-7 minutes).
7. **Season Gravy:** Stir in black pepper and cayenne pepper (if using). Taste and season with salt as needed (sausage can be salty). Keep warm over low heat.
8. **Serve:** Split warm biscuits in half and generously spoon the hot sausage gravy over them. Serve immediately.

## Tips & Variations

- For a richer gravy, use half-and-half or heavy cream instead of milk.
- Add a pinch of dried sage or thyme to the gravy for extra savory flavor.
- Make ahead: The biscuit dough can be prepared and cut, then frozen on a baking sheet. Once frozen, transfer to a freezer bag and bake from frozen, adding a few extra minutes to the baking time. Gravy reheats well on the stovetop with a splash of milk if needed.
- Serve with a side of scrambled eggs or fried potatoes for a complete breakfast.

*📸 Photography note: Rustic farmhouse style. A stack of golden-brown, flaky biscuits split open, drenched in thick, creamy sausage gravy, served on a classic white diner plate. A sprig of fresh parsley for garnish. The plate sits on a well-worn wooden table, with soft, natural morning light. A steaming mug of coffee in the background, slightly out of focus.*

## 👵 Grandma's Secret: Biscuits and Sausage Gravy

> "Grandma Helen always added a tiny pinch of sugar (about a teaspoon) to her gravy. 'It balances the savory just right,' she'd wink, 'and makes it so smooth, everyone always asks for my recipe!'"

# Dutch Baby Pancake

📍 *Midwest — The Sunday Morning Showstopper*

> Part pancake, part popover, all drama. This puffy, golden beauty billows up in the oven like a golden cloud, its edges reaching for the sky while the center stays custardy and tender. Dust it with powdered sugar, squeeze fresh lemon over the top, and listen to your family gasp as you bring it to the table.

## Instructions

1. **Position the rack and preheat.** Place an oven rack in the lower third of the oven. Put a 12-inch cast iron skillet (or oven-safe skillet) in the oven. Preheat to 425°F. Let the skillet heat for at least 15 minutes.

2. **Make the batter.** While the oven preheats, add eggs to a blender. Blend on high for 1 minute until light and frothy. Add milk, flour, sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. Blend for 30 seconds until completely smooth. (No blender? Whisk vigorously in a bowl until smooth with no lumps.)

3. **Prep the pan.** Carefully remove the screaming-hot skillet from the oven. Add butter — it will sizzle and foam immediately. Swirl to coat the bottom and sides completely.

4. **Pour and bake.** Immediately pour the batter into the center of the hot, buttery skillet. Don't stir or spread — just pour. Return to the oven immediately.

5. **Bake without peeking.** Bake for 20–25 minutes until the dutch baby has puffed dramatically, the edges are deeply golden brown, and the center is set but still slightly custardy. Do not open the oven door during baking — this can cause it to deflate.

6. **Serve immediately.** Remove from oven — it will begin to deflate within minutes (this is normal and expected). Dust generously with powdered sugar, squeeze lemon juice over the top, and serve with your choice of toppings.

## Tips & Variations

- **Room Temperature Is Key:** Cold eggs and milk won't give you the same dramatic puff. Let them sit out for 30 minutes, or warm the milk gently.
- **Hot Pan, Cold Batter:** The contrast between the hot butter and cold batter creates steam, which creates the puff. Don't skip preheating the pan.
- **Cast Iron is Best:** The heat retention of cast iron gives the best rise. A well-seasoned pan also releases easily.
- **Apple Dutch Baby:** Sauté 2 sliced apples with 2 tablespoons butter, ¼ cup brown sugar, and cinnamon in the skillet first. Pour batter over the apples.
- **Savory Version:** Omit sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Add ¼ cup shredded cheese and fresh herbs. Serve with bacon and eggs.
- **Berry Topping:** Warm mixed berries with a splash of maple syrup for a compote.
- **Smaller Portions:** Make individual dutch babies in 6-inch skillets — reduce bake time to 15–18 minutes.

## 🌾 Did You Know?

> Despite its name, the Dutch Baby isn't Dutch at all — it's German. The dish originated in Seattle in the early 1900s at Manca's Cafe, where owner Victor Manca served a version of the German apfelpfannkuchen (apple pancake). The story goes that his young daughter couldn't pronounce "Deutsch" (German) and called it "Dutch" instead. The name stuck. The dish migrated to the Midwest with German immigrants and became a beloved Sunday morning tradition, especially in Wisconsin and Minnesota's German communities. It's the kind of recipe that makes the cook look like a genius while requiring almost no effort — the best kind of Heartland cooking.

## Ingredients

- 2 (16.3 oz / 462g) cans refrigerated biscuit dough (e.g., Pillsbury Grands!), cut into quarters
- 1 cup (200g) granulated sugar
- 2 tsp ground cinnamon
- ½ cup (113g) unsalted butter, melted
- ¾ cup (150g) packed light brown sugar
- ½ tsp vanilla extract
- Optional: ½ cup chopped pecans or walnuts

## Instructions

1. **Prepare Pan & Preheat:** Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 10-inch (25 cm) Bundt pan or a 12-cup fluted tube pan generously with butter or cooking spray.
2. **Coat Biscuit Pieces:** In a large zip-top bag, combine the granulated sugar and cinnamon. Add the biscuit dough quarters to the bag, seal, and shake well until all pieces are evenly coated.
3. **Layer in Pan:** Arrange about half of the coated biscuit pieces in the bottom of the prepared Bundt pan. If using, sprinkle half of the chopped pecans or walnuts over the biscuits. Add the remaining coated biscuit pieces, and then the rest of the nuts.
4. **Make Syrup:** In a small saucepan, combine the melted butter, brown sugar, and vanilla extract. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the brown sugar is dissolved and the mixture is smooth and bubbling gently.
5. **Pour & Bake:** Carefully pour the hot brown sugar syrup evenly over the biscuits in the Bundt pan.
6. **Bake:** Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until golden brown and cooked through. To check for doneness, you can insert a thin skewer into the center; if it comes out clean, it's ready.
7. **Cool & Invert:** Let the Monkey Bread cool in the pan for 5-10 minutes. This is crucial for the syrup to set slightly and for easy removal.
8. **Serve:** Place a serving plate upside down over the Bundt pan, then carefully invert the pan to release the Monkey Bread onto the plate. Serve warm, allowing everyone to pull apart the sticky, delicious pieces.

## Tips & Variations

- Add a tablespoon of orange zest to the sugar-cinnamon coating for a bright, citrusy flavor.
- For a richer caramel flavor, add a pinch of salt to the brown sugar syrup.
- Serve with a side of cream cheese glaze (powdered sugar, milk, and cream cheese whisked together) for an extra decadent touch.
- Make ahead: Assemble the bread the night before, cover, and refrigerate. Let it sit at room temperature for 30 minutes before baking, increasing baking time by 5-10 minutes.

## 🌾 Did You Know?

> Monkey Bread, also known as pull-apart bread or bubble bread, gained popularity in the mid-20th century as a fun, interactive treat. Its name likely comes from the way people pick apart the sticky pieces with their fingers, much like a monkey. It became a beloved staple in Midwestern homes, often appearing at brunches, holiday breakfasts, and casual get-togethers, embodying the region's love for comforting, communal foods.

## 👵 Grandma's Secret: Monkey Bread

> "Grandma Rose always tossed a few caramel candies in between the biscuit layers before pouring the butter sauce. 'They melt into little pockets of gooey perfection,' she'd confide, 'and make it extra special, a real surprise in every bite!'"

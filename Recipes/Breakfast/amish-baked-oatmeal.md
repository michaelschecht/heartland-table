Baked oatmeal is a cornerstone of Amish "church lunch" — the communal meal served after Sunday worship. In many Amish communities, families take turns hosting, and baked oatmeal can be made in large batches with minimal fuss, making it the perfect dish for feeding 30+ people in a farmhouse kitchen. The recipe has barely changed in over a century.

## How Midwestern Food Pairing Works

Wine pairing is about complementary flavors, tannins, and acidity. Midwest pairing is about **context** — the situation, the people, the weather, and the specific type of passive-aggressive conversation happening at the table.

Every recipe in this cookbook comes with a "Pairs Well With" suggestion. Here's the master list.

---

### 🥞 Buttermilk Pancakes
**Pairs well with:** Saturday morning cartoons, a parent who doesn't check their email until Monday, and the faint sound of a lawn mower three houses down that reminds you it's summer.

### 🥣 Amish Baked Oatmeal
**Pairs well with:** The first cold morning of fall, a flannel shirt you've owned since 2003, and the quiet satisfaction of being up before everyone else in the house.

### 🍳 Midwestern Breakfast Casserole
**Pairs well with:** Christmas morning, houseguests you love (but are ready to leave), and the knowledge that you assembled this last night and are therefore a genius.

### 🍳 Farmhouse Skillet Hash
**Pairs well with:** A hangover you won't admit to, black coffee, and the Sunday paper (or your phone — we don't judge).

### 🧀 Wisconsin Fried Cheese Curds
**Pairs well with:** A pitcher of Spotted Cow, a Packers game (any quarter), and your friend who keeps saying "we should do this more often" (you should).

### 🥚 Classic Deviled Eggs
**Pairs well with:** Your aunt asking when you're getting married, a paper plate that's working too hard, and the realization that you've had six and nobody's counting.

### 🍲 Minnesota Wild Rice Dip
**Pairs well with:** The first snowfall, a Costco membership, and the kind of party where everyone stands in the kitchen even though the living room is right there.

### 🍕 Tater Tot Hotdish
**Pairs well with:** A Wednesday night, an argument about nothing, children who won't eat anything else, and the comforting knowledge that this recipe has never once failed anyone.

### 🍕 Chicago Deep Dish Pizza
**Pairs well with:** An out-of-town visitor you're trying to impress, a very long Netflix queue, and a nap planned for immediately after.

### 🍕 Detroit-Style Pizza
**Pairs well with:** Telling everyone at the party that "actually, Detroit pizza is the best style" and being right for once.

### 🥩 Kansas City BBQ Brisket
**Pairs well with:** 14 hours of doing nothing but checking a smoker, your neighbor leaning over the fence saying "smells good," and the complete absence of any vegetable.

### 🥪 Chicago Italian Beef
**Pairs well with:** A stack of napkins the size of a phone book, a willingness to lean over a counter, and the total abandonment of dignity.

### 🥪 Indiana Pork Tenderloin Sandwich
**Pairs well with:** A bun that is comically too small, a county fair, and the confidence to eat something wider than your face in public.

### 🥪 Nebraska Runza
**Pairs well with:** A Husker game, a 20°F November afternoon, and a level of state pride that borders on religion.

### 🍝 St. Louis Toasted Ravioli
**Pairs well with:** A Cardinals game, a beer you've never heard of, and the smug knowledge that St. Louis invented something New York didn't.

### 🍝 Cincinnati Chili
**Pairs well with:** An unwavering opinion about whether to go 3-Way or 5-Way, a conversation about which parlor is best, and a complete willingness to eat chili on spaghetti in front of people from Texas.

### 🍲 Wisconsin Beer Cheese Soup
**Pairs well with:** A Packers loss (or win — both require cheese), the first week of October, and a bread bowl that you will absolutely eat.

### 🍲 Hearty Chicken Noodle Soup
**Pairs well with:** A cold that isn't bad enough to go to the doctor but is bad enough for sympathy, a blanket, and reruns of anything.

### 🍲 Booyah
**Pairs well with:** A community you've known your entire life, a fall festival, and the kind of October day where the leaves are perfect and you pretend winter isn't coming.

### 🥗 Green Bean Casserole
**Pairs well with:** Thanksgiving, your uncle's political opinions, and the unspoken agreement that you will eat this even though you had it last year and the year before and every year since 1955.

### 🥔 Cheesy Funeral Potatoes
**Pairs well with:** Any major life event (emphasis on "any"), a church basement with folding chairs, and the quiet heroism of the person who made three pans.

### 🥗 Creamy Coleslaw
**Pairs well with:** A fish fry, paper plates, a folding table on a lawn, and a mosquito you're pretending isn't there.

### 🌽 Corn on the Cob
**Pairs well with:** August, specifically. A garden hose still running. A neighbor you wave to but have never learned the last name of. Peak Midwest.

### 🍰 Classic Apple Pie
**Pairs well with:** Thanksgiving, the argument about whether it needs ice cream or whipped cream (ice cream, obviously), and a belt that's been loosened one notch.

### 🍫 Buckeye Candies
**Pairs well with:** An Ohio State game, a tin that someone "just happened to have," and eating seven while telling yourself you'll stop at three.

### 🍰 German Chocolate Cake
**Pairs well with:** A birthday where no one asks how old you are, a church bake sale where this will sell for $45, and someone saying "oh, you *made* this?"

### 🎪 Iowa State Fair Funnel Cake
**Pairs well with:** A ride you'll regret, a sunburn developing, corn dogs consumed earlier, and powdered sugar on every item of clothing you own.

### 🍫 Puppy Chow
**Pairs well with:** A Christmas movie, a zip-lock bag on a road trip, and the lie you tell yourself that "this is for the kids."

## The Universal Midwest Pairing

When in doubt, every dish in this cookbook pairs well with:

☑️ A 20-minute goodbye at the door  
☑️ Someone saying "Oh, you shouldn't have" (they should have)  
☑️ A weather conversation that lasts longer than the meal  
☑️ "Ope"  
☑️ A second helping you didn't ask for but will accept  
☑️ The quiet drive home where everyone agrees that was nice

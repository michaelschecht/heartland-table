| What We Say | What We Mean |
|------------|-------------|
| "Oh, that's *interesting*." | "I hate it but I'll eat it politely." |
| "That's... different!" | "What have you done." |
| "Bless their heart." | "They are wrong and I feel sorry for them." |
| "You didn't have to do that!" | "You absolutely should have done that and I'm glad you did." |
| "I'll have to get that recipe." | "I will never make this." |
| "Oh, I couldn't eat another bite!" | "I am about to eat three more bites." |
| "It's *fine*." | "It is not fine." |
| "We should do this more often!" | "I will see you at the next funeral." |
| "Well, that's one way to do it." | "That is the wrong way to do it." |

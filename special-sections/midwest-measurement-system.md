Every cookbook gives you precise measurements. Cups, tablespoons, grams — all very useful if you're the kind of person who owns a kitchen scale and has never once eyeballed anything.

This is not that cookbook.

In the Midwest, recipes have been passed down for generations via index cards written in handwriting that can only be described as "beautiful but medically illegible." The measurements on these cards follow a system that predates the metric system, the imperial system, and in some cases, written language itself.

We present, for the first time in print, the **Official Midwest Measurement Conversion Chart.**

## Volume Measurements

| Midwest Term | Approximate Equivalent | Usage Context |
|-------------|----------------------|---------------|
| **A smidge** | ⅛ teaspoon or less | Spices. "Add a smidge of cayenne." (A smidge means you should barely be able to detect it. If you can taste it, that was too much smidge.) |
| **A pinch** | ¼ teaspoon | Salt, mostly. A pinch is what you can hold between your thumb and two fingers. Grandma's pinch is always bigger than yours. |
| **A dash** | ½ teaspoon, give or take | Liquid seasonings. "A dash of Worcestershire." (Pronounced "wuster-shur" or "that brown sauce.") |
| **A dollop** | 1-3 tablespoons | Sour cream, whipped cream, or mayo. A dollop is the amount that falls off a spoon in one satisfying plop. |
| **A splash** | 1-3 tablespoons (liquid) | "A splash of milk," "a splash of vinegar." The pour lasts exactly as long as the word "splash" takes to say out loud. |
| **A glug** | 2-4 tablespoons | Oil or vinegar. A glug is one full tilt of the bottle. Two glugs is "generous." Three glugs means you're making salad dressing now. |
| **Some** | ¼ to ½ cup | The most versatile measurement. "Add some cheese." Some is more than a little but less than a lot. You'll feel it when you get there. |
| **A good amount** | ½ to 1 cup | When "some" isn't enough but a specific number feels too committal. "A good amount of onion." |
| **A handful** | Whatever your hand holds | Literally your hand. Note: Grandpa's handful ≠ a child's handful. Adjust accordingly. |
| **Enough** | The correct amount | The most precise Midwest measurement. "Add enough broth until it looks right." You'll know. Trust yourself. If you don't know, call your mom. |
| **A bunch** | 1-2 cups, or one literal bunch | Could be a literal bunch of parsley, or a figurative bunch of shredded cheese. Context clues required. |
| **A mess of** | A very generous amount | "A mess of green beans." Implies abundance bordering on excess, which is exactly right. |
| **Till it looks right** | Unmeasurable | The most advanced measurement. Requires years of intuition and at least one phone call to someone who's made this before. |

## Temperature Measurements

| Midwest Term | Approximate Equivalent |
|-------------|----------------------|
| **Low and slow** | 250-300°F |
| **Medium** | 350°F (this is the answer to everything) |
| **Hot oven** | 400-425°F |
| **Real hot** | 450°F+ |
| **Till it's golden** | Whatever temperature, whatever time. Just watch it. |
| **Till it's bubblin'** | It's ready when the edges are doing the thing |

## Time Measurements

| Midwest Term | Approximate Equivalent |
|-------------|----------------------|
| **A minute** | 5-45 minutes |
| **A bit** | 15 minutes to 2 hours |
| **A while** | 1-4 hours |
| **All day** | 6+ hours, usually in a slow cooker |
| **Overnight** | 8-14 hours. Set it before bed, deal with it in the morning. |
| **Till it's done** | The only time measurement that truly matters |

## Quantity Measurements (for Potlucks)

| Midwest Term | Actual Meaning |
|-------------|---------------|
| **"I made a little extra"** | Enough to feed 12 people |
| **"Just a small batch"** | 3 dozen cookies minimum |
| **"I doubled the recipe"** | There will be leftovers for a week and you will send some home with every guest |
| **"I brought enough for everyone"** | The 9x13 pan plus a backup pan in the car, just in case |
| **"Oh, I barely made anything"** | She made four dishes and a dessert |

## The Golden Rule

When in doubt: **more is more.** No Midwesterner has ever been criticized for making too much food. Running out of food at a gathering, however, is a scandal that will be discussed in hushed tones for years.

*This chart has been peer-reviewed by a panel of grandmothers from seven Midwestern states. They all disagreed on the specifics but agreed that "you'll just know" is a valid measurement.*

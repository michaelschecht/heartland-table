# 🧪 Will It Hotdish?

> *The experimental wing of the Heartland Table test kitchen, where we ask the question no one asked: can we put it in a 9x13, add cream of mushroom soup, top it with something crunchy, and call it a hotdish?*

---

## The Rules

1. Every dish must use a 9x13-inch baking dish
2. At least one cream-of-something soup must be involved
3. There must be a crunchy topping
4. It must be baked until bubbly
5. A Midwestern grandmother must theoretically be willing to serve it at a church supper (this is the hardest rule)

Each experiment is rated on three scales:
- **Hotdish Authenticity** (1-5 🫕) — How Midwestern does this feel?
- **Actually Delicious?** (1-5 ⭐) — Would you make this again?
- **Should We Have Done This?** (Yes / Maybe / We're Sorry)

## Experiment #1: Taco Hotdish 🌮🫕

*The gateway hotdish. The one that already exists in thousands of Midwestern kitchens but nobody talks about in polite company.*

### Ingredients
- 1½ lbs ground beef, browned with 1 packet taco seasoning
- 1 can cream of chicken soup
- 1 cup sour cream
- 1 can (15 oz) black beans, drained
- 1 can (15 oz) corn, drained
- 1 cup salsa
- 2 cups shredded Mexican blend cheese
- **Crunchy topping:** Crushed Doritos (yes, Doritos)

### Method
Layer: beef mixture → soup/sour cream blend → beans and corn → cheese → crushed Doritos. Bake at 350°F for 30 minutes.

### Verdict
- **Hotdish Authenticity:** 🫕🫕🫕🫕 — This already exists in every Lutheran church cookbook, just filed under "Mexican Casserole."
- **Actually Delicious?** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ — Offensively good. Don't tell anyone how much you liked it.
- **Should We Have Done This?** **Yes.** This is the best hotdish that nobody admits to making.

## Experiment #2: Pizza Hotdish 🍕🫕

*What if pizza... was a hotdish? What if we're the first people brave enough to ask this?*

### Ingredients
- 1 lb Italian sausage, browned and crumbled
- 1 bag (16 oz) rotini or penne pasta, cooked
- 1 can cream of mushroom soup
- 1 jar (24 oz) marinara sauce
- 1 cup mini pepperoni
- 1 cup sliced black olives
- ½ cup diced green peppers
- 3 cups shredded mozzarella

### Method
Mix pasta, sauce, soup, sausage, and vegetables. Pour into dish. Top with mozzarella, pepperoni, and garlic croutons. Bake at 375°F for 25 minutes.

### Verdict
- **Hotdish Authenticity:** 🫕🫕🫕🫕 — Suspiciously close to several existing church cookbook recipes called "Italian Bake."
- **Actually Delicious?** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ — It's pizza. In a pan. With cream of mushroom soup. It works and we're not apologizing.
- **Should We Have Done This?** **Yes.** Children will request this weekly.

## Experiment #3: Pad Thai Hotdish 🍜🫕

*Now we're getting experimental. East meets Midwest. Fish sauce meets cream of chicken.*

### Ingredients
- 1 lb chicken breast, diced and cooked
- 8 oz rice noodles, cooked and drained
- 1 can cream of chicken soup
- 3 tablespoons peanut butter
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon sriracha
- 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
- 1 cup bean sprouts
- ½ cup shredded carrots
- 3 green onions, sliced
- **Crunchy topping:** Crushed peanuts + fried wonton strips

### Method
Mix chicken, noodles, soup-peanut-butter-soy mixture, and vegetables. Pour into dish. Top with peanuts and wonton strips. Bake at 350°F for 25 minutes. Squeeze lime over the top.

### Verdict
- **Hotdish Authenticity:** 🫕🫕 — We're pushing boundaries. Grandma is skeptical but intrigued.
- **Actually Delicious?** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ — Surprisingly incredible. The cream of chicken + peanut butter combo creates a sauce that has no right being this good.
- **Should We Have Done This?** **Maybe.** Serve it at the potluck without telling anyone what's in it. Reveal the truth only after they ask for the recipe.

## Experiment #4: Breakfast Hotdish... For Dinner 🥞🫕

*Pancakes, sausage, eggs, and syrup. In a 9x13 pan. For dinner. Because rules are a construct.*

### Ingredients
- 2 cups pancake mix, prepared as batter
- 1 lb breakfast sausage, browned and crumbled
- 8 eggs, scrambled soft
- 1 can cream of chicken soup + ½ cup milk
- 1½ cups shredded cheddar
- **Crunchy topping:** Crushed cornflakes + butter + a drizzle of maple syrup

### Method
Pour half the pancake batter into the dish. Layer sausage and scrambled eggs. Pour soup mixture over. Add remaining batter. Top with cheese, cornflakes, and a maple syrup drizzle. Bake at 375°F for 35 minutes.

### Verdict
- **Hotdish Authenticity:** 🫕🫕🫕 — The breakfast casserole already exists. We just... maximized it.
- **Actually Delicious?** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ — Kids will lose their minds. Adults will pretend they're eating it ironically.
- **Should We Have Done This?** **Yes.** Breakfast for dinner is already Midwest canon. We just formalized it.

## Experiment #5: Sushi Hotdish 🍣🫕

*The final frontier. Have we gone too far? Almost certainly. Did we do it anyway? Obviously.*

### Ingredients
- 3 cups cooked sushi rice (seasoned with rice vinegar)
- 1 lb imitation crab, chopped
- 1 can cream of mushroom soup
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- 1 cup diced cucumber
- ½ cup shredded nori
- 2 cups shredded mozzarella (don't @ us)
- **Crunchy topping:** Panko breadcrumbs + sesame seeds + crushed wasabi peas

### Method
Mix rice, crab, soup, soy sauce, sesame oil, and half the nori. Pour into dish. Top with mozzarella, panko-sesame mix, and remaining nori. Bake at 375°F for 25 minutes. Serve with spicy mayo and pickled ginger.

### Verdict
- **Hotdish Authenticity:** 🫕 — We have strayed far from God's light and also Minnesota.
- **Actually Delicious?** ⭐⭐⭐ — It's... not bad? It's like a deconstructed California roll baked into a casserole. Which is what it is.
- **Should We Have Done This?** **We're sorry.** But also... try it? And don't tell the sushi chef.

## The Final Verdict

**Everything can be a hotdish.** This is the fundamental theorem of Midwestern cooking. Give us any cuisine on earth, a can of cream-of-something, a crunchy topping, and a 9x13 pan, and we will hotdish it.

Is it always a good idea? No.  
Will we do it anyway? Absolutely.  
Will we bring it to the potluck? Only if someone asks what we're bringing, at which point we'll say "Oh, just a little something" and produce a 9x13 pan of Pad Thai Hotdish like it's perfectly normal.

Because in the Midwest, the hotdish is not just a dish.  
It's a philosophy.

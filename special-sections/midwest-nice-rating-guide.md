# 🫕 The Midwest Nice Rating™ Scale

> *How likely is this dish to show up at your door, uninvited, wrapped in foil, carried by a neighbor who "just happened to make extra"?*

## How It Works

Every recipe in this cookbook is rated on the **Midwest Nice Rating™** — a proprietary 1-to-5 scale measured in hotdish icons (🫕) that quantifies the probability of each dish appearing in your life without warning.

The rating considers five critical factors:

1. **Ease of doubling** — Can it be scaled up for a crowd without thinking?
2. **Transportability** — Will it survive the passenger seat of a Subaru Outback?
3. **Universal acceptability** — Will even the pickiest Lutheran eat it?
4. **Occasion versatility** — Does it work for births, deaths, and everything in between?
5. **Leftovers potential** — Does it reheat well enough to be eaten for four consecutive days?

## The Scale

### 🫕 — "They Made It for Themselves and Thought of You"
*A polite gesture, but this dish requires effort or fresh ingredients that suggest premeditation, not spontaneity.*

**Examples:** Detroit-Style Pizza, Chicago Deep Dish Pizza  
**Translation:** "I specifically chose to make this for you, which means we're actually close friends."

---

### 🫕🫕 — "They Saw It on Pinterest and Wanted to Try It"  
*A step above basics. Shows initiative. The neighbor was probably already cooking and thought, why not make two?*

**Examples:** Booyah, German Chocolate Cake, St. Louis Toasted Ravioli  
**Translation:** "I had a productive Saturday and you're benefiting from it."

---

### 🫕🫕🫕 — "Standard Operating Procedure"  
*This is the baseline Midwest Nice food delivery. Expected at most gatherings. Would raise no eyebrows.*

**Examples:** Green Bean Casserole, Hearty Chicken Noodle Soup, Deviled Eggs, Buttermilk Pancakes  
**Translation:** "Something happened in your life — good or bad — and I responded with food. As is tradition."

---

### 🫕🫕🫕🫕 — "The Potluck Power Move"  
*This dish doesn't just show up — it ARRIVES. It's the first thing people eat and the first pan that empties. Bringing this is a statement.*

**Examples:** Cheesy Funeral Potatoes, Wisconsin Beer Cheese Soup, Kansas City BBQ Brisket, Puppy Chow  
**Translation:** "I am a generous and competent person, and I want everyone at this potluck to know it."

---

### 🫕🫕🫕🫕🫕 — "You Sneezed Once and Now There's a Hotdish on Your Porch"  
*The apex of Midwest Nice. This dish materializes the moment any life event occurs within a 3-block radius. You don't request it. You don't even mention being hungry. It just... appears.*

**Examples:** Tater Tot Hotdish, Midwestern Breakfast Casserole, Cheesy Funeral Potatoes  
**Translation:** "I heard through the church phone tree that your cousin's neighbor's dog is sick and I thought you could use a hotdish."

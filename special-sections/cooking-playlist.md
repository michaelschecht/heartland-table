## How To Use This

Each recipe in this cookbook includes a suggested song or artist. These aren't random — they're matched to the **energy** of cooking and eating each dish. The slow braise gets slow rock. The Friday night fish fry gets upbeat country. The funeral potatoes get... well, something respectful but comforting.

Below is the complete playlist. If we ever make a Spotify list, you'll find it linked from the cookbook's website.

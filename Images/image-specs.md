## General Guidelines

- **Resolution:** 1024×1024 minimum for AI-generated; 300 DPI for print
- **Aspect ratio:** Square (1:1) for flexibility; can crop to landscape for full-page spreads
- **Consistency:** Maintain the same "world" — similar wood tones, lighting warmth, and prop styles across all rustic images
- **No text on images** — text overlays will be added in layout
- **Food should look real and appetizing** — avoid overly stylized or artificial appearance

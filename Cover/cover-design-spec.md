## Creative Direction

### Concept
A warm, inviting cover that immediately evokes the Midwest — amber wheat fields, rustic warmth, and the promise of a home-cooked meal. It should feel like opening the door to a farmhouse kitchen on a fall evening.

### Composition
- **Top third:** Title in warm cream/ivory serif font, large and confident
- **Center:** Hero image — a rustic table scene with a cast iron skillet, fresh-baked bread, and seasonal produce (corn, apples, squash)
- **Bottom third:** Subtitle and a wheat/grain decorative border
- **Background:** Warm, weathered wood texture or amber-toned wheat field, slightly blurred

### Color Palette
- **Primary:** Amber (#D4A843), Warm Wheat (#E8D5A3)
- **Secondary:** Muted Sage (#8B9E82), Cream (#F5F0E1)
- **Accent:** Deep Cranberry (#8B2252), Rustic Red (#A0522D)
- **Text:** Cream/ivory on dark backgrounds, deep brown on light

### Typography
- **Title:** Large serif font (Playfair Display, Cormorant Garamond, or similar) — elegant but warm
- **Subtitle:** Smaller sans-serif or light serif — clean complement to the title
- **"A Mid-West Cookbook"** in a slightly condensed tracking beneath the main title

### Mood
- Warm and nostalgic, not kitschy
- Elevated comfort — this is a quality cookbook, not a pamphlet
- Should appeal to both the "I grew up eating this" crowd and the "I want to discover this" crowd

### Photography Elements for Cover Shot
- Cast iron skillet with golden cornbread
- A few stalks of dried wheat
- Red-checkered cloth peeking from the edge
- Warm, late-afternoon golden-hour lighting
- Shallow depth of field — sharp focus on the food, soft background
